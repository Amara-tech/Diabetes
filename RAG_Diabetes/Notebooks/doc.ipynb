Diabetes is accompanied by a multitude of severe, long-term complications that\\nultimately cause more adult cases of blindness, renal failure and amputations in the US than\\nany other disease. In addition, people with T2DM have a twofold to fourfold increase in their\\nrisk of developing cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease and stroke. The enormous\\nhuman and financial costs that accompany T2DM, and the challenge of treating it effectively\\nonce it has developed, make it an appropriate target for prevention. As reviewed here,\\nsubstantial progress has been made in the past decade in developing and evaluating effective\\npreventive strategies.\\nPREVENTIVE STRATEGIES BASED ON PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\\nT2DM is characterized by insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction (impaired insulin\\nsecretion), the balance between which varies widely between individuals.2,3 Insulin resistance\\nis frequently well established in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, and it is the\\npresence of β-cell dysfunction that distinguishes those in whom glucose intolerance worsens\\nfrom those in whom it remains stable.4 Interventions that decrease insulin resistance and\\npreserve or improve β-cell function are likely to be effective in slowing progression from\\nimpaired glucose tolerance to diabetes, or even allowing reversion to normal glucose tolerance.\\nMany interventions, such as drugs, weight loss and physical activity, are thought to improve\\ninsulin resistance and might also affect insulin secretion.\\nEARLY PREVENTION STUDIES\\nRandomized clinical trials of preventive strategies for T2DM began in the 1960s, notably\\nbefore the current definitions were established for impaired fasting glucose and impaired\\nglucose tolerance—both of which indicate a high risk of T2DM. Three early trials examined\\ndrugs then in common use to treat T2DM. In the Whitehall study, 204 men with impaired\\nglucose tolerance were randomly assigned either phenformin or placebo.5 In the 181 patients\\nwho completed 5 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of diabetes was 14% in the\\nphenformin-treated patients and 16% in placebo-treated patients, with a cumulative incidence\\nrate ratio (drug versus placebo) of 0.9 (95% CI 0.4–1.8). 6 In the Bedford study, 241 men and\\nwomen with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly assigned either the sulfonylurea,\\ntolbutamide, or placebo. The 8.5-year cumulative incidence of diabetes was 9% in the\\ntolbutamide group and 8% in the placebo group (incidence rate ratio 1.1, 95% CI 0.5–2.5) and\\na subsequent report of 10 years’ follow-up of these patients also showed no significant effect\\nof tolbutamide on the incidence of diabetes.7 The third major study of this era was conducted\\nCrandall et al.

They were also randomly assigned tolbutamide, placebo or\\nno drug treatment. The 10-year cumulative incidence of diabetes was 10% in men assigned\\ntolbutamide treatment and 13% in the two groups assigned placebo or no drug (incidence rate\\nratio 0.8, 95% CI 0.3–2.0). 6\\nNone of these pioneering studies established whether diabetes could be prevented or delayed,\\nand their findings were inconclusive owing to the small sample sizes used. Whether\\npharmacologic prevention of T2DM was possible remained unknown into the 1990s. The\\nMalmöhus study, however, provided two additional provocative findings. The results of the\\nstudy were originally reported according to patients’ estimated adherence to drug treatment,\\nrather than according to their original treatment assignment (i.e. by intention to treat).8 Of the\\nfew tolbutamide-treated participants who were estimated to have taken the drug throughout\\nthe study, however, none developed diabetes. This outcome has been widely cited as evidence\\nthat tolbutamide has the potential to prevent diabetes. This conclusion of the article was,\\nhowever, inappropriately based on the analysis of adherence. Analysis by intention to treat,\\ngenerally considered the proper way to assess treatment effects in a clinical trial, did not support\\na preventive effect of tolbutamide. In addition, although treatment and formal follow-up of the\\nstudy participants ended in 1975, the investigators continued to follow up participants until\\n1987 for mortality and cause of death. The all-cause mortality rate ratio (drug compared with\\nplacebo or no drug) was 0.66 (95% CI 0.39–1.10) and the ischemic heart disease mortality rate\\nratio was 0.42 (95% CI 0.16–1.12). 9\\nWhile the conclusions of this study were limited by its small size and wide CIs, the Malmöhus\\nstudy provided early support for the hypothesis that the benefits of treatments for\\nhyperglycemia might persist long after active intervention ends. This hypothesis has been\\nsupported by later, much larger clinical trials.10,11\\nSTUDIES OF LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION\\nDiet and exercise\\nOver the past 10 years several randomized clinical trials have formally tested the hypothesis\\nthat lifestyle modification, namely weight loss and/or increased activity or exercise, can prevent\\nT2DM.12 Their findings indicate that such changes can prevent the onset of diabetes in people\\nat risk (Table 1).\\nThe first of these studies was conducted in Chinese community health clinics and included 577\\nindividuals with impaired glucose tolerance. 13 Individuals were assigned, according to which\\nclinic they attended, to a program of dietary modification, exercise, or both, and were followed\\nup for 6 years. The dietary intervention focused on increased consumption of vegetables and\\nreduced consumption of alcohol and simple carbohydrates; overweight individuals (BMI ≥25\\nkg/m2) were also advised to limit their energy intake. Participants in the exercise-only group\\nwere instructed to increase their daily activity by the equivalent of at least 20 min of brisk\\nwalking. The diet plus exercise group received both interventions, and patients who attended\\nusual-care clinics served as a control group. The 6-year cumulative incidence of diabetes was\\nhigh in all groups (48%, 41%, 46% and 68% in the diet-only, exercise-only, diet plus exercise\\nand control groups, respectively). The relationship between the amount of weight lost and\\ndiabetes incidence was inconsistent and all three interventions were similarly effective in\\npreventing diabetes.\\nThe Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS)14 was a randomized study of 522 over-weight,\\nmiddle-aged adults with impaired glucose tolerance.

Although\\nthis study was not designed to assess the individual contributions of the diet and exercise\\ncomponents, participants who undertook particularly vigorous leisure-time physical activities\\nhad a markedly reduced risk of diabetes.15 After cessation of the intervention, the reduction\\nin diabetes risk persisted—over 7 years of follow-up, the intervention group had an overall\\nreduction in their risk of diabetes of 43% compared with the control group; during the post\\nintervention period, the risk reduction was 36% in the subset of participants who were free\\nfrom diabetes at the end of the intervention period despite modest weight regain (1.3 kg\\nregained of the original 3.1 kg lost by this subgroup) in the intervention group.16 As might be\\nexpected, individuals who maintained the changes to their lifestyle during the extended follow-\\nup period had the greatest reduction in their risk of diabetes (a 46% risk reduction compared\\nwith those who did not achieve their goals). In a multivariate analysis that considered the\\nsuccess of achieving all five lifestyle goals, only weight reduction remained a significant\\ndeterminant of diabetes risk.\\nThe largest and most comprehensive lifestyle modification study was the US Diabetes\\nPrevention Program (DPP; for a list of members of the DPP Research Group see Supplementary\\ninformation online).17,18 The DPP randomly allocated 3,234 overweight, mostly middle-aged\\nadults with impaired glucose tolerance and fasting plasma glucose values of 5.3 mmol/l or\\nhigher to intensive lifestyle intervention, metformin or placebo. An additional 585 participants\\nwere randomly assigned troglitazone therapy, but recruitment to this group and participants’\\nongoing treatment were terminated prematurely owing to concern over possible hepatotoxic\\neffects.17 Troglitazone was not approved as a study drug in some locations that had enrolled\\nAmerican Indian participants. The DPP preferentially enrolled individuals at high risk of\\ndeveloping T2DM: overall, 45% of participants were from high-risk ethnic groups, and 20%\\nwere aged 60–85 years at baseline.\\nThe DPP intensive lifestyle intervention was intended to achieve a 7% loss in body weight\\nover 24 weeks. Participants were instructed to perform 150 min moderate-intensity physical\\nactivity (such as brisk walking) per week and to eat a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet. They also\\nreceived one-to-one counseling to aid these changes in behavior that was continued (generally\\nmonthly) after the initial 24-week period to help maintain weight loss and activity levels. The\\nlifestyle-intervention group achieved a mean weight loss of 7% (an average of 7.0 kg) within\\nthe first year, and had an overall mean weight loss of 5.6% (an average of 5.6 kg) during follow-\\nup (mean duration 2.8 years); the physical activity goals were met by 74% of participants in\\nthe first 24 weeks of the study.\\nThe DPP lifestyle intervention was associated with a 58% reduction in the incidence of\\ndiabetes, compared with placebo plus standard lifestyle recommendations.19 Weight loss was\\nthe predominant predictor of reduced diabetes incidence, with a 16% reduction in risk per\\nkilogram of weight lost.20 However, participants who achieved their exercise goals but not\\ntheir weight loss goals also experienced some reduction in diabetes risk (44%, compared with\\nplacebo-treated individuals).

Troglitazone reduced the development of diabetes by around\\n50% over 2.5 years in a group of women with prior gestational diabetes (~60% also had\\nimpaired glucose tolerance at baseline). 38 Troglitazone administration in the DPP was\\ndiscontinued prematurely owing to its hepatotoxic effects, but during the average 0.9 years of\\nexposure, diabetes incidence was reduced by 75%.39 Administration of rosiglitazone over 3\\nyears has since been studied in 5,269 patients with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose\\ntolerance, or both.40 The incidence of diabetes was reduced by 62%, and 50% of rosiglitazone-\\ntreated patients reverted to normoglycemia (compared with 30% of placebo-treated patients).\\nLike metformin, rosiglitazone seems to be most effective in individuals with a high BMI\\n(rosiglitazone confers risk reductions of 40% for BMI <28 kg/m2 and 68% for BMI >33 kg/\\nm2). Notable side effects, including weight gain (rosiglitazone-treated patients gained 2.2 kg\\nmore than placebo-treated patients) and edema were observed, as they are when rosiglitazone\\nis used to treat established diabetes. The frequency of congestive heart failure was also\\nincreased in the rosiglitazone group (hazard ratio 7.03, 95% CI 1.60–30.9), but there were few\\ncases in this generally healthy population. Questions have been raised about potential\\ncardiovascular toxic effects of rosiglitazone and this issue remains to be resolved.41 Additional\\nconcerns about rosiglitazone include one report of an increased rate of osteoporotic fracture\\namong diabetic women treated with this drug.42 These concerns might indicate an\\nunacceptable risk-to-benefit ratio for thiazolidinediones, particularly rosiglitazone, in diabetes\\nprevention.43,44\\nAcarbose\\nThe α-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose, has been studied in a number of clinical trials.37,45,\\n46 Most notably, the STOP-NIDDM (Study to Prevent Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes\\nMellitus) trial47 reported that acarbose treatment was associated with a 25% reduction in the\\nincidence of diabetes in a large (n = 1,429), cohort of high-risk individuals with impaired\\nglucose tolerance. Approximately one-quarter of the cohort (including 31% of the acarbose\\ngroup) did not complete the study, however, with the consequence that this estimate of the\\nmagnitude of acarbose’s effect on diabetes incidence might be unreliable. The particularly high\\ndrop-out rate in acarbose-treated patients was attributed to its well-known gastrointestinal side\\neffects. Acarbose might, therefore, have limited value for diabetes prevention in general\\npractice.\\nWeight-loss agents\\nWeight-loss agents have been studied in small numbers of individuals with impaired fasting\\nglucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or both. Orlistat, an intestinal lipase inhibitor, reduced\\nthe development of diabetes by 40–52% in obese people with impaired glucose tolerance. 48,\\n49 The effect of this drug on diabetes might be attributable to weight loss, which was greater\\nthan that achieved with lifestyle change alone.

Screening for prediabetes should be considered in people aged 45 years\\nand older, and for adults younger than 45 years who are overweight or obese and have additional\\nrisk factors, such as a family history of diabetes, prior gestational diabetes or belonging to a\\nhigh-risk ethnic group.95 Measurement of fasting plasma glucose levels will identify\\nindividuals with impaired fasting glucose, but an OGTT is necessary to identify impaired\\nglucose tolerance. Impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance are considered to\\nconfer equivalent increases in risk for the development of diabetes; the combination of impaired\\nfasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance confers a greater increase in risk than either\\nvariable alone.96,97 Strategies that employ measurements of fasting glucose and routine\\nclinical variables to identify high-risk individuals have been proposed and have the advantage\\nof not requiring administration of an OGTT.98,99 Such management algorithms seem to be\\ncapable of discriminating between individuals with varying levels of diabetes risk in clinical\\npractice.\\nLifestyle modification, including a weight-loss goal of 5–10% of initial weight and moderate-\\nintensity physical activity for 30 min per day, can provide the greatest reduction in diabetes\\nrisk and should be implemented for all individuals at risk for diabetes. This approach has an\\nexcellent safety profile and might also be the most cost-effective intervention. The role of\\npharmacologic agents is somewhat less clear. However, substantial evidence supports the use\\nof metformin in patients who either fail to achieve these lifestyle goals or who have additional\\nrisk factors at baseline (such as both impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance,\\na strong family history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension), especially if they are\\nyounger than 60 years and have a BMI of 35 kg/m or greater.2,96 Acarbose might be considered\\nfor these patients, but it is less well tolerated and more expensive than metformin, and requires\\nthree doses daily. Although effective, routine use of thiazolidinediones cannot currently be\\nrecommended because of their high cost and emerging evidence of adverse effects.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nTremendous progress has been made over the past decade in the identification of effective\\nstrategies to prevent or delay onset of T2DM. Important limitations in our current knowledge,\\nhowever, include the lack of adequate data to determine whether these preventive approaches\\ncan slow the development of serious vascular complications of diabetes and ultimately reduce\\ndiabetes-related mortality. In addition, although important efforts in this regard are underway,\\nthe public-health messages implicit in diabetes risk and diabetes prevention remain under-\\nappreciated. Probably the greatest challenge continues to be in translating scientific discoveries\\ninto programs that are adequately funded and broadly available to individuals at high risk of\\ndeveloping diabetes.\\nKEY POINTS\\n• Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease that is responsible for\\nenormous human and financial costs\\n• Lifestyle modification (i.e. modest weight loss and increased physical activity) is\\nthe most consistently effective approach to diabetes prevention\\n• Medications, including metformin, acarbose and thiazolidinediones, are effective\\ntherapies for preventing or delaying diabetes\\nCrandall et al.

Studies have demonstrated that, in some countries, diabetes affects \\nup to 10% of the population aged 20 years and older. This rate may be doubled if those \\nwith impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are also included.\\nThe manifestations of diabetes cause considerable human suffering and enormous \\neconomic costs. Both acute and late diabetic complications are commonly encountered. \\nLong-term complications represented by cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular\\naccidents, end-stage renal disease, retinopathy and neuropathies are already major causes \\nof morbidity, disability and premature death in countries of this Region.\\nThe development of long-term complications is influenced by hyperglycaernia. Poor \\ncontrol of diabetes accelerates their progression. Thus, to prevent complications, good \\ncontrol of diabetes is essential and the management of diabetes should t herefore aim to \\nimprove glycaemic control beyond that required to control its symptoms. Intensified\\ntherapy and maintaining near-normal blood glucose levels can result in considerable\\nreduction in the risk of development of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.\\nHowever, despite the high prevalence of diabetes and its complications and the\\navailability of successful prevention strategies, essential health care requirements and\\nfacilities for self-care are often inadequate in this Region. Action is needed at all levels of \\nhealth care and in the various aspects of diabetes care to bridge this gap and to improve \\nhealth care delivery to people with diabetes. Education of the health care team on the \\nmanagement of diabetes and on how to educate people with diabetes is one major aspect \\nthat requires strengthening.\\nEven though resources vary widely within the Region, the primary resource in diabetes \\ncare is now recognized to be the people with diabetes themselves, supported by well \\ntrained and enthusiastic health care professionals. This resource can be strengthened\\nnearly everywhere by education.'),\n",

It is often sufficient to measure the blood glucose values only after \\nfasting and 2 hours after a 75 g oral (anhydrous) glucose load. The diagnostic criteria are \\nshown in Table 1.\\nThe requirements for diagnostic confirmation for a person presenting with severe \\nsymptoms and gross hyperglycaemia will differ from those of the asymptomatic patient \\nwhose blood glucose levels are just above the diagnostic cut-off values. For the\\nasymptomatic patient, at least one additional test result with a value in the diabetic range \\nis desirable.\\nClinical diagnosis should never be based on the presence of glycosuria alone.

The \\nincreasing prevalence of T2DM is followed by some of \\nthe most influential factors such as age, obesity and a \\nsedentary lifestyle (Lazarevic et al., 2006). The factors \\nthat affect the increase of T2DM over a long period of \\ntime leads to a variety of abnormalities in various \\norgans, including microvascular, macrovascular, \\nneurological and infectious complications (A, \\nNajafipoor, Aliasgarzadeh, Niafar, & Mobasseri, \\n2012).  \\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the \\nInternational Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported that \\nthe number of patients with diabetes worldwide was \\nprojected to increase to more than 300 million people \\nin 2025 and 366 million by 2030. This is up from 171 \\nmillion in 2000 (Animaw & Seyoum, 2017). Different \\nassociations such as the American Diabetes \\nAssociation (ADA), the American College of \\nPhysicians (ACP) and the International Diabetes \\nFederation (IDF) assumed that the goal of glycemic \\ncontrol was to decrease the HbA1c level, as shown by \\nthe epidemiology analysis where each decrease by \\n1% in HbA1c is associated with a 14% reduction in \\nthe risk of myocardial infarction (MI), a 21% \\nreduction in mortality associated with T2DM and a \\n37% reduction in microvascular complications (A et \\nal., 2012). \\nT2DM is caused by insulin resistance which affects \\nthe process of carbohydrate metabolism.

Insulin is a hormone made up of small \\nproteins produced from the beta cells of the pancreas’ \\nislets of Langerhans and it has an important role i n \\nsaving energy (Fabricio, Chango, Cezar, & Mathias, \\n2016). Blood glucose level and HbA1c decreased \\nrapidly and significantly after physical exercise \\n(Bruce, Kriketos, Cooney, & Hawley, 2004). \\nPhysical exercise as an intervention to maintain \\nglycemic control in T2DM is widely used and it has \\nbeen frequently reported on to date. Many studies \\nhave focused on the effect of physical exercise in \\nT2DM related to its actions, laboratory parameters \\nand organ damage (Thent, Das, & Henry, 2013). The \\naim of the present study was to search and review the \\nfindings from the randomized or non-randomized \\nscientific published literature studies focusing on the \\nT2DM patients’ used types of exercise and their effect \\non glycemic control. \\nMATERIALS AND METHODS  \\nSearching strategy \\nThis study employed a systematic review on the \\neffectiveness of the physical exercise for glycemic \\ncontrol done by T2DM patients. A comprehensive \\nliterature search was conducted using the \\nScienceDirect, ProQuest, Scopus, and Pubmed journal \\ndatabases. This study began with determining the \\ntopic, searching for original articles and seeing if they \\nmatched with the inclusion criteria. The keywords \\nused were type 2 diabetes mellitus, physical exercise, \\nglycemic control, blood glucose and HbA1c. \\nInclusion and exclusion criteria \\nThe inclusion and exclusion criteria used for this \\nstudy have been presented in Table 1. \\nData extraction and quality assessment \\nThe title, abstract and the article were reviewed \\nindependently. The information was taken from each \\nstudy using a collection form that consisted of the \\nauthors, the date of the study, the population, the \\nexercise type, the outcome measures, the study \\ndesign and the duration of the intervention and its \\nintensity. The quality assessment for each selected \\nstudy was conducted using the PRISMA method. \\nRESULTS  \\nThe results of the data search identified 1145 relevant \\nstudies, but 885 studies were excluded after the title \\nand abstract analysis. Therefore, 260 full-text articles \\nwere assessed for eligibility after excluding 155 \\nduplicates. In the final stage of the eligibility \\nassessment, 141 articles were excluded and the \\nremaining 14 studies were included in this review. A \\nflow diagram of the PRISMA method of search and \\nselection has been shown in Figure 1. \\nAll of the 14 selected studies were published in \\nEnglish. The population was T2DM patients and the \\nmajority were published after 2004. All of the \\nparticipants were aged between 18 years and 70 \\nyears old without complications. Three studies used \\nfemale participants only and 11 studies used mixed \\nparticipants. All of the participants were people with \\ndiabetes mellitus without insulin dependence. \\nThe interventions that were used were aerobic \\nexercise, resistance exercise and a combination of \\nexercises that were both aerobic and resistance. Four \\nstudies used an aerobic only intervention. One study \\nused a resistance only intervention. Four studies used \\na combination of aerobic and resistance exercises. \\nFour studies used an aerobic exercise, in addition \\nwith tension and combination exercises. One study \\nused a combination of exercises. The intensity of \\nphysical exercise ranged from 2 to 3 times a week for \\n30 to 60 minutes. The intervention was targeted at \\nreducing HbA1c and glucose level. \\nSamples for the examination of blood sugar and \\nHbA1c were obtained both before exercise and after \\nthe administration of the intervention. The length of \\nthe re-examination of the blood glucose levels and \\nHbA1c varied. All of the results of the study stated \\nthat aerobic and resistance studies gave significant \\nresults for glycemic control, blood sugar levels and \\nHbA1c. Aerobic was the most widely used and \\nmodest exercise used to maintain glycemic control. \\nThe main characteristics of the included studies \\nhave been summarized in Table 2. \\nDISCUSSION \\nThe previous study pointed that there were 3 types of \\nphysical exercise; aerobic exercise, resistance \\nexercise and flexibility and balance exercise. These \\ncan be done by the T2DM patients as an intervention \\nfor glycemic control (Colberg et al., 2016). Another \\nstudy also stated that aerobic exercise was the most \\ncommonly done for maintaining glycemic control and \\nresistance exercise was number two (Services, 2018). \\nThe study’s result before was related to the results of  \\nthe current study in that aerobic exercise, resistance \\nexercise and a combination of aerobic and resistance \\nexercise were the most common types of physical \\nexercise used for maintaining glycemic control \\nrespectively. Compared with supervised aerobic or \\nsupervised resistance exercise alone, combined \\nexercise showed there to be more of an improvement \\nin HbA1c levels. \\nAerobics is a form of exercise that involves the \\nrepeated and continuous movement of large muscle \\ngroups. Aerobic activities include walking, cycling, \\njogging, and swimming (T. et al., 2018). Aerobic \\nexercises consist of many different types of exercise. \\nExercise is performed at moderate levels of intensity, \\nso they can be undertaken for extended periods of \\ntime that maintain an increasing heart rate. Activities \\nsuch as cycling, swimming, jogging, rowing, cross-\\ncountry skiing and aerobic dancing require oxygen to \\nproduce ATP (Adenosine Tri-Phosphate). Aerobic \\nexercise improves oxygen consumption and it also \\nincreases the functioning of the cardiovascular and \\nrespiratory systems (Thent et al., 2013).'),\n",

Aerobic was \\nmostly done, followed by resistance or a combination \\nof exercises. The fact that has to be of concern was \\nthat resistance exercise depends on the use of \\nequipment. It could be costly and proper supervision \\nis needed (Thent et al., 2013). Many other aspects \\nhave to be concerned with related to resistance \\nexercises such as the knowledge of exercise, the \\neconomic aspect of exercise and the sustainability of \\nthe exercise(Training, The, & Of, 2006). On the other \\nhand, aerobic exercise is devoid of using equipment \\n(Segal et al., 2018). \\nIn this systematic review, the authors reviewed 14 \\nresearch articles about physical exercise (aerobics, \\nstretching, and a combination of aerobics and \\nstretching) as it relates to glycemic control (blood \\nsugar and Hba1c). The result of this review were the \\nsame as the previous study, in that aerobics \\nsignificantly reduce blood glucose and Hba1c through \\nincreased insulin sensitivity (Harrison, Shields, \\nTaylor, & Frawley, 2016). During exercise, muscle \\ncontraction stimulates an increase in AMPK activity \\n(AMP-activated protein kinase). This activation then \\nstimulates GLUT4 translocation into the cell \\nmembrane, thereby increasing the glucose uptake \\n(Bird & Hawley, 2017). In T2DM, there are \\ndeficiencies in the insulin receptors which results in \\nimpaired glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. \\nHowever, exercise therapy could restore the defects \\nof insulin by providing GLTU4 translocation (Bird & \\nHawley, 2017). \\nThe provision of aerobic exercise in terms of \\nevidence and theory can reduce blood sugar and \\nHbA1c levels. This was in accordance with the \\nsystematic results of this review, in that the most \\ncommon intervention that was significant at reducing \\nsugar levels and HbA1c was aerobics. In theory, there \\nwere more optimal and significant exercises which \\nreduced the blood sugar levels and HbA1c and it is \\nrecommended by the ADA and the American College \\nof Sports Medicine that these are used in combination \\nrather than just aerobics (Activity, 2004). This could \\nbe done through two mechanisms. Increasing insulin \\nsensitivity is a result of exercise-specific adaptations. \\nIncreased lean body mass (hypertrophy) is associated \\nwith resistance training, which contributes to \\nincreased glucose disposal. The problem with the \\nauthors when conducting the systematic review was \\nthat there has been only a small amount of research \\nevaluating the benefits of aerobic combination \\ntraining and resistance in the diabetic population. \\nResistance exercise developed proper glucose \\ncontrol and less insulin resistance among the T2DM \\npatients. Resistance exercises are an exercise that has \\nto be performed against resistance. Examples of \\nresistance exercises include weight lifting. Unlike \\naerobic exercise, resistance exercises rely on \\nequipment. Similar to aerobic exercise, resistance \\nexercises are useful therapeutic tools in the \\nmanagement of T2DM. In addition, it was also proven \\nto be safe and efficacious for the elderly insulin \\nresistant diabetic patients. Resistance exercise has \\nbeen reported to enhance insulin sensitivity, daily \\nenergy expenditure and quality of life. Furthermore, \\nresistance training has the potential to increase \\nmuscle strength, lean muscle mass and bone mineral \\ndensity, which could enhance both functional status \\nand glycemic control. \\nThe schedule of carrying out exercises for \\nbetween 30 - 60 minutes 3 times/week was \\nreasonable; this consisted of 1 hour of physical \\nexercise 3x/week to reduce the capillary glucose \\nlevel. At least 150 minutes/week of physical activity \\nand dietary changes resulting in a weight loss of 5% –\\n7% is recommended to prevent or delay the onset of \\nT2DM in populations at high risk and in those with \\npre-diabetes. Not allowing more than 2 days to elapse \\nbetween exercise sessions is recommended to \\nenhance insulin action (Services, 2018).  \\nThe limitation of this study was the variation of the \\nintervention’s duration. Two studies had an \\nintervention duration that was for 7 days. The other \\nstudies were done over more than 8 weeks \\nCONCLUSION \\nThe present systematic review revealed the \\neffectiveness of physical exercise on glycemic control. \\nFrom the published data, it can be concluded that \\nexercise-based research on a schedule of 3 times a \\nweek for 60 minutes per session over 2 months was \\n \\nFigure 1.

Increasing the glycemic control in patients with T2DM is not enough if it is only treated with anti-hyperglycemic drugs. Physical exercise is an activity that is planned, structured and carried out to improve health or physical fitness and it is an effective way to improve glycemic control. The aim of this study was to search and review the research on effectiveness of physical exercise on glycemic control in T2DM. Methods: We searched the scientific literature on T2DM and physical exercise in the ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Scopus, Ebsco and Pubmed databases for original research studies and then we reviewed them systematically. Of the 1145 articles retrieved, 14 studies were obtained by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) method Results: Aerobic physical exercise improved the glycemic control of T2DM and it was widely used and significant for glycemic control. The schedule of 3 times a week for 60 minutes per session over 2 months was widely used and significant when it came to reducing blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

Members of the ADA Profes-\\nsional Practice Committee, a multidisciplinary expert committee (https://doi.org/\\n10.2337/dc22-SPPC), are responsible for updating the Standards of Care annually,\\nor more frequently as warranted.

Historically, diabetes technology has been divided into two\\nmain categories: insulin administered by syringe, pen, or pump (also called continu-\\nous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]), and blood glucose as assessed by blood\\nglucose monitoring (BGM) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). More recently,\\ndiabetes technology has expanded to include hybrid devices that both monitor glu-\\ncose and deliver insulin, some automatically, as well as software that serves as a\\nmedical device, providing diabetes self-management support. Diabetes technology,\\nwhen coupled with education and follow-up, can improve the lives and health of\\npeople with diabetes; however, the complexity and rapid change of the diabetes\\ntechnology landscape can also be a barrier to patient and provider imple-\\nmentation.\\nGENERAL DEVICE PRINCIPLES\\nRecommendations\\n7.1 The type(s) and selection of devices should be individualized based on\\na person’s speciﬁc needs, desires, skill level, and availability of devices.\\nIn the setting of an individual whose diabetes is partially or wholly\\nmanaged by someone else (e.g., a young child or a person with cogni-\\ntive impairment), the caregiver’s skills and desires are integral to the\\ndecision-making process.

Other\\nsources, including health care providers\\nand device manufacturers, can help\\npeople troubleshoot when dif ﬁculties\\narise.\\nEducation and Training\\nIn general, no device used in diabetes\\nmanagement works optimally without\\neducation, training, and follow-up.\\nThere are multiple resources for\\nonline tutorials and training videos as\\nwell as written material on the use of\\ndevices. Patients vary in terms of com-\\nfort level with technology, and some\\nprefer in-person training and support.\\nPatients with more education regard-\\ning device use have better outcomes\\n(1); therefore, the need for additional\\neducation should be periodically\\nassessed, particularly if outcomes are\\nnot being met.\\nUse in Schools\\nInstructions for device use should be\\noutlined in the student’sd i a b e t e sm e d i -\\ncal management plan (DMMP). A back-\\nup plan should be included in the\\nDMMP for potential device failure (e.g.,\\nBGM and/or injected insulin). School\\nnurses and designees should complete\\ntraining to stay up to date on diabetes\\ntechnologies prescribed for use in the\\nschool setting. Updated resources to\\nsupport diabetes care at school, includ-\\ning training materials and a DMMP tem-\\nplate, can be found online at www.\\ndiabetes.org/safeatschool.\\nInitiation of Device Use\\nUse of CGM devices should be considered\\nfrom the outset of the diagnosis of diabe-\\ntes that requires insulin management\\n(2,3). This allows for close tracking of glu-\\ncose levels with adjustments of insulin\\ndosing and lifestyle modiﬁcations and\\nremoves the burden of frequent BGM. In\\nappropriate individuals, early use of auto-\\nmated insulin delivery (AID) systems or\\ncontinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion\\n(CSII) may be considered. Interruption of\\naccess to CGM is associated with a wors-\\nening of outcomes (4); therefore, it is\\nimportant for individuals on CGM to have\\nconsistent access to devices.\\nBLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING\\nRecommendations\\n7.6 People with diabetes should\\nbe provided with blood glu-\\ncose monitoring devices as\\nindicated by their circumstan-\\nces, preferences, and treat-\\nment. People using continuous\\nglucose monitoring devices\\nmust have access to blood glu-\\ncose monitoring at all times.A\\n7.7 People who are on insulin\\nusing blood glucose monitor-\\ning should be encouraged to\\ncheck when appropriate based\\non their insulin regimen. This\\nmay include checking when\\nfasting, prior to meals and\\nsnacks, at bedtime, prior to\\nexercise, when low blood\\nglucose is suspected, after\\ntreating low blood glucose lev-\\nels until they are normoglyce-\\nmic, and prior to and while\\nperforming critical tasks such\\nas driving.B\\n7.8 Providers should be aware of\\nthe differences in accuracy\\namong blood glucose meters—\\nonly U.S. Food and Drug Admin-\\nistration–approved meters with\\nproven accuracy should be\\nused, with unexpired strips pur-\\nchased from a pharmacy or\\nlicensed distributor.E\\n7.9 Although blood glucose moni-\\ntoring in individuals on nonin-\\nsulin therapies has not\\nconsistently shown clinically\\nsigniﬁcant reductions in A1C, it\\nmay be helpful when altering\\ndiet, physical activity, and/or\\nmedications (particularly medi-\\ncations that can cause hypogly-\\ncemia) in conjunction with a\\ntreatment adjustment pro-\\ngram. E\\n7.10 Health care providers should\\nbe aware of medications and\\nother factors, such as high-\\nd o s ev i t a m i nCa n dh y p o x e m i a ,\\nthat can interfere with glucose\\nmeter accuracy and provide\\nclinical management as indi-\\ncated. E\\nMajor clinical trials of insulin-treated\\npatients have included BGM as part of\\nmultifactorial interventions to demon-\\nstrate the beneﬁt of intensive glycemic\\ncontrol on diabetes complications (5).\\nBGM is thus an integral component of\\neffective therapy of patients taking insu-\\nlin. In recent years, CGM has emerged\\nas a method for the assessment of glu-\\ncose levels (discussed below). Glucose\\nmonitoring allows patients to evaluate\\ntheir individual response to therapy\\nand assess whether glycemic targets\\nare being safely achieved. Integrating\\nresults into diabetes management can\\nbe a useful tool for guiding medical\\nnutrition therapy and physical activity,\\npreventing hypoglycemia, or adjusting\\nmedications (particularly prandial insulin\\ndoses). The patient’ss p e c iﬁc needs and\\ngoals should dictate BGM frequency\\nand timing or the consideration of CGM\\nuse.

The current ISO and FDA standards\\nare compared in Table 7.1. In Europe,\\ncurrently marketed monitors must meet\\ncurrent ISO standards. In the U.S., cur-\\nrently marketed monitors must meet\\nthe standard under which they were\\napproved, which may not be the cur-\\nrent standard. Moreover, the monitor-\\ning of current accuracy is left to the\\nmanufacturer and not routinely checked\\nby an independent source.\\nPatients assume their glucose monitor\\nis accurate because it is FDA cleared, but\\noften that is not the case. There is sub-\\nstantial variation in the accuracy of\\nwidely used BGM systems (6,7). The Dia-\\nbetes Technology Society Blood Glucose\\nMonitoring System Surveillance Program\\nprovides information on the performance\\nof devices used for BGM (www.diabe\\ntestechnology.org/surveillance/). In one\\nanalysis, only 6 of the top 18 glucose\\nmeters met the accuracy standard (8).\\nThere are single-meter studies in which\\nbeneﬁts have been found with individual\\nmeter systems, but few studies have\\ncompared meters in a head-to-head man-\\nner. Certain meter system characteristics,\\nsuch as the use of lancing devices that\\nare less painful (9) and the ability to reap-\\nply blood to a strip with an insufﬁcient\\ninitial sample, may also be beneﬁcial to\\npatients (10) and may make BGM less\\nburdensome for patients to perform.\\nCounterfeit Strips\\nPatients should be advised against pur-\\nchasing or reselling preowned or second-\\nhand test strips, as these may give incor-\\nrect results. Only unopened and unex-\\npired vials of glucose test strips should\\nbe used to ensure BGM accuracy.\\nOptimizing Blood Glucose\\nMonitoring Device Use\\nOptimal use of BGM devices requires\\nproper review and interpretation of data,\\nby both the patient and the provider, to\\nensure that data are used in an effective\\nand timely manner. In patients with type\\n1 diabetes, there is a correlation between\\ngreater BGM frequency and lower A1C\\n(11). Among patients who check their\\nblood glucose at least once daily, many\\nreport taking no action when results are\\nhigh or low (12). Some meters now pro-\\nvide advice to the user in real time when\\nmonitoring glucose levels (13), whereas\\no t h e r sc a nb eu s e da sap a r to fi n t e -\\ngrated health platforms (14). Patients\\nshould be taught how to use BGM data\\nto adjust food intake, exercise, or phar-\\nmacologic therapy to achieve speci ﬁc\\ngoals. The ongoing need for and\\nfrequency of BGM should be reevaluated\\nat each routine visit to ensure its effec-\\ntive use (12,15,16).\\nPatients on Intensive Insulin Regimens\\nBGM is especially important for insulin-\\ntreated patients to monitor for and pre-\\nvent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.\\nMost patients using intensive insulin regi-\\nmens (multiple daily injections [MDI] or\\ninsulin pump therapy) should be encour-\\naged to assess glucose levels using BGM\\n(and/or CGM) prior to meals and snacks,\\nat bedtime, occasionally postprandially,\\nprior to exercise, when they suspect low\\nblood glucose, after treating low blood\\nglucose until they are normoglycemic,\\nand prior to and while performing critical\\nt a s k ss u c ha sd r i v i n g .F o rm a n yp a t i e n t s\\nusing BGM this requires checking up to\\n6–10 times daily, although individual\\nneeds may vary.

Glucose monitoring may also be\\nuseful in assessing hypoglycemia, glu-\\ncose levels during intercurrent illness,\\nor discrepancies between measured\\nA1C and glucose levels when there is\\nconcern an A1C result may not be reli-\\nable in speciﬁc individuals. It may be\\nuseful when coupled with a treatment\\nadjustment program.

A trial of once-daily\\nBGM that included enhanced patient\\nfeedback through messaging found\\nno clinically or statistically signi ﬁcant\\nchange in A1C at 1 year (23).

Higher oxygen ten-\\nsions (i.e., arterial blood or oxygen ther-\\napy) may result in false low glucose\\nreadings, and low oxygen tensions (i.e.,\\nhigh altitude, hypoxia, or venous blood\\nreadings) may lead to false high glucose\\nreadings.

A variety of metrics have been\\nproposed (80) and are discussed in Sec-\\ntion 6, “Glycemic Targets” (https://doi\\n.org/10.2337/dc22-S006). CGM is essen-\\ntial for creating an ambulatory glucose\\nproﬁle and providing data on TIR, per-\\ncentage of time spent above and below\\nrange, and variability (81).\\nReal-time Continuous Glucose\\nMonitoring Device Use in Pregnancy\\nOne well-designed RCT showed a reduc-\\ntion in A1C levels in adult women with\\ntype 1 diabetes on MDI or CSII who were\\npregnant and using rtCGM in addition to\\nstandard care, including optimization of\\npre- and postprandial glucose targets\\n(82). This study demonstrated the value\\nof rtCGM in pregnancy complicated by\\ntype 1 diabetes by showing a mild\\nimprovement in A1C without an increase\\nin hypoglycemia as well as reductions in\\nlarge-for-gestational-age births, length of\\nstay, and neonatal hypoglycemia (82). An\\nobservational cohort study that evalu-\\nated the glycemic variables reported\\nusing rtCGM found that lower mean glu-\\ncose, lower standard deviation, and a\\nhigher percentage of time in target range\\nwere associated with lower risk of large-\\nfor-gestational-age births and other\\nadverse neonatal outcomes (83). Use of\\nthe rtCGM-reported mean glucose is\\nsuperior to use of estimated A1C, glucose\\nmanagement indicator, and other calcula-\\ntions to estimate A1C given the changes\\nto A1C that occur in pregnancy (84). Two\\nstudies employing intermittent use of\\nrtCGM showed no difference in neonatal\\noutcomes in women with type 1 diabetes\\n(85) or gestational diabetes mellitus\\n(86).\\nUse of Professional and Intermittent\\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring\\nProfessional CGM devices, which pro-\\nvide retrospective data, either blinded\\nor unblinded, for analysis, can be used\\nto identify patterns of hypo- and hyper-\\nglycemia (87,88). Professional CGM can\\nbe helpful to evaluate patients when\\neither rtCGM or isCGM is not available\\nto the patient or the patient prefers a\\nblinded analysis or a shorter experience\\nwith unblinded data. It can be particu-\\nlarly useful to evaluate periods of hypo-\\nglycemia in patients on agents that can\\ncause hypoglycemia in order to make\\nmedication dose adjustments. It can\\nalso be useful to evaluate patients for\\nperiods of hyperglycemia.\\nThere are some data showing beneﬁt\\nof intermittent use of CGM (rtCGM or\\nisCGM) in individuals with type 2 diabe-\\ntes on noninsulin and/or basal insulin\\ntherapies (59,89). In these RCTs, patients\\nwith type 2 diabetes not on intensive\\ninsulin regimens used CGM intermittently\\ncompared with patients randomized to\\nBGM. Both early (59) and late improve-\\nments in A1C were found (59,89).\\nUse of professional or intermittent\\nCGM should always be coupled with\\nanalysis and interpretation for the\\npatient, along with education as needed\\nto adjust medication and change life-\\nstyle behaviors (90–92).\\nSide Effects of CGM Devices\\nContact dermatitis (both irritant and\\nallergic) has been reported with all\\ndevices that attach to the skin\\n(93–95). In some cases this has been\\nlinked to the presence of isobornyl\\nacrylate, which is a skin sensitizer and\\ncan cause an additional spreading\\nallergic reaction (96–98). Patch testing\\ncan be done to identify the cause of\\nthe contact dermatitis in some cases\\n(99). Identifying and eliminating tape\\nallergens is important to ensure com-\\nfortable use of devices and enhance\\npatient adherence (100–103).

Others use insulin pumps or\\nAID devices (see section on those topics\\nbelow). For patients with diabetes who\\nuse insulin, insulin syringes and pens are\\nboth able to deliver insulin safely and\\neffectively for the achievement of glyce-\\nmic targets. When choosing among deliv-\\nery systems, patient preferences, cost,\\ninsulin type and dosing regimen, and self-\\nmanagement capabilities should be con-\\nsidered. Trials with insulin pens generally\\nshow equivalence or small improvements\\nin glycemic outcomes when compared\\nwith use of a vial and syringe. Many indi-\\nviduals with diabetes prefer using a pen\\ndue to its simplicity and convenience. It is\\nimportant to note that while many insulin\\ntypes are available for purchase as either\\npens or vials, others may only be avail-\\nable in one form or the other and there\\nmay be signi ﬁcant cost differences\\nbetween pens and vials (seeTable 9.4for\\na list of insulin product costs with dosage\\nforms). Insulin pens may allow people\\nwith vision impairment or dexterity\\nissues to dose insulin accurately\\n(124–126), while insulin injection aids\\nare also available to help with these\\nissues. (For a helpful list of injection aids,\\nsee main.diabetes.org/dforg/pdfs/2018/\\n2018-cg-injection-aids.pdf). Inhaled insu-\\nlin can be useful in people who have an\\naversion to injection.\\nThe most common syringe sizes are\\n1 mL, 0.5 mL, and 0.3 mL, allowing\\ndoses of up to 100 units, 50 units, and\\n30 units of U-100 insulin, respectively.\\nIn a few parts of the world, insulin\\nsyringes still have U-80 and U-40\\nmarkings for older insulin concentra-\\ntions and veterinary insulin, and\\nU-500 syringes are available for the\\nuse of U-500 insulin. Syringes are gen-\\nerally used once but may be reused\\nb yt h es a m ei n d i v i d u a li nr e s o u r c e -\\nlimited settings with appropriate stor-\\nage and cleansing (126).\\nInsulin pens offer added convenience\\nby combining the vial and syringe into a\\nsingle device. Insulin pens, allowing\\npush-button injections, come as dispos-\\nable pens with preﬁlled cartridges or\\nreusable insulin pens with replaceable\\ninsulin cartridges. Pens vary with\\nrespect to dosing increment and mini-\\nmal dose, which can range from half-\\nunit doses to 2-unit dose increments. U-\\n500 pens come in 5-unit dose incre-\\nments. Some reusable pens include a\\nmemory function, which can recall dose\\namounts and timing. Connected insulin\\npens (CIPs) are insulin pens with the\\ncapacity to record and/or transmit insu-\\nlin dose data. They were previously\\nknown as “smart pens.” Some CIPs can\\nbe programmed to calculate insulin\\ndoses and provide downloadable data\\nreports. These pens are useful to assist\\npatient insulin dosing in real time as\\nwell as for allowing clinicians to retro-\\nspectively review the insulin doses that\\nwere given and make insulin dose\\nadjustments (127).\\nNeedle thickness (gauge) and length\\nis another consideration. Needle gauges\\nrange from 22 to 33, with higher gauge\\nindicating a thinner needle. A thicker\\nneedle can give a dose of insulin more\\nquickly, while a thinner needle may\\ncause less pain. Needle length ranges\\nfrom 4 to 12.7 mm, with some evidence\\nsuggesting shorter needles may lower\\nthe risk of intramuscular injection.\\nWhen reused, needles may be duller\\nand thus injection more painful. Proper\\ninsulin injection technique is a requisite\\nfor obtaining the full beneﬁts of insulin\\ntherapy.

AID\\nsystems, discussed below, are preferred\\nover nonautomated pumps and MDI in\\npeople with type 1 diabetes.\\nMost studies comparing MDI with\\nCSII have been relatively small and of\\nshort duration. However, a systematic\\nreview and meta-analysis concluded\\nthat pump therapy has modest advan-\\ntages for lowering A1C (/C00.30% [95%\\nCI /C00.58 to /C00.02]) and for reducing\\nsevere hypoglycemia rates in children\\nand adults (133). There is no consensus\\nto guide choosing which form of insulin\\nadministration is best for a given\\npatient, and research to guide this deci-\\nsion-making is needed (134). Thus, the\\nchoice of MDI or an insulin pump is\\noften based upon the individual charac-\\nteristics of the patient and which is\\nmost likely to beneﬁt them. Newer sys-\\ntems, such as sensor-augmented pumps\\nand AID systems, are discussed below.\\nAdoption of pump therapy in the U.S.\\nshows geographical variations, which\\nmay be related to provider preference\\nor center characteristics (135,136) and\\nsocioeconomic status, as pump therapy\\nis more common in individuals of higher\\nsocioeconomic status as re ﬂected by\\nrace/ethnicity, private health insurance,\\nfamily income, and education (135,136).\\nGiven the additional barriers to opti-\\nmal diabetes care observed in disad-\\nvantaged groups (137), addressing\\nthe differences in access to insulin\\npumps and other diabetes technology\\nmay contribute to fewer health dis-\\nparities.\\nPump therapy can be successfully\\nstarted at the time of diagnosis\\n(138,139). Practical aspects of pump\\ntherapy initiation include assessment\\nof patient and family readiness, if\\napplicable (although there is no con-\\nsensus on which factors to consider in\\nadults [140] or pediatric patients),\\nselection of pump type and initial\\npump settings, patient/family educa-\\ntion on potential pump complications\\n(e.g., DKA with infusion set failure),\\ntransition from MDI, and introduction\\nof advanced pump settings (e.g., tem-\\nporary basal rates, extended/square/\\ndual wave bolus).\\nOlder individuals with type 1 diabetes\\nbeneﬁt from ongoing insulin pump ther-\\napy. There are no data to suggest that\\nmeasurement of C-peptide levels or anti-\\nbodies predicts success with insulin\\npump therapy (141,142). Additionally,\\nfrequency of follow-up does not inﬂu-\\nence outcomes. Access to insulin pump\\ntherapy should be allowed or continued\\nin older adults as it is in younger people.\\nComplications of the pump can be\\ncaused by issues with infusion sets (dis-\\nlodgement, occlusion), which place\\npatients at risk for ketosis and DKA and\\nthus must be recognized and managed\\nearly (143). Other pump skin issues\\nincluded lipohypertrophy or, less fre-\\nquently, lipoatrophy (144,145), and pump\\nsite infection (146). Discontinuation of\\npump therapy is relatively uncommon\\ntoday; the frequency has decreased over\\nthe past few decades, and its causes\\nhave changed (146,147). Current reasons\\nfor attrition are problems with cost or\\nwearability, dislike for the pump, subopti-\\nmal glycemic control, or mood disorders\\n(e.g., anxiety or depression) (148).\\nInsulin Pumps in Youth\\nThe safety of insulin pumps in youth\\nhas been established for over 15 years\\n(149). Studying the effectiveness of CSII\\nin lowering A1C has been challenging\\nbecause of the potential selection bias\\nof observational studies. Participants on\\nCSII may have a higher socioeconomic\\nstatus that may facilitate better glyce-\\nmic control (150) versus MDI. In addi-\\ntion, the fast pace of development of\\nnew insulins and technologies quickly\\nrenders comparisons obsolete. How-\\never, RCTs comparing CSII and MDI with\\ninsulin analogs demonstrate a modest\\nimprovement in A1C in participants on\\nCSII (151,152). Observational studies,\\nregistry data, and meta-analysis have\\nalso suggested an improvement of gly-\\ncemic control in participants on CSII\\n(153–155). Although hypoglycemia was\\na major adverse effect of intensi ﬁed\\ninsulin regimen in the Diabetes Control\\nand Complications Trial (DCCT) (156),\\ndata suggest that CSII may reduce the\\nrates of severe hypoglycemia compared\\nwith MDI (155,157–159).\\nThere is also evidence that CSII may\\nreduce DKA risk (155,160) and diabetes\\ncomplications, particularly retinopathy\\nand peripheral neuropathy in youth,\\ncompared with MDI (161). Finally, treat-\\nment satisfaction and quality-of-life\\nmeasures improved on CSII compared\\nwith MDI (162,163). Therefore, CSII can\\nbe used safely and effectively in youth\\nwith type 1 diabetes to assist with\\nachieving targeted glycemic control\\nwhile reducing the risk of hypoglycemia\\nand DKA, improving quality of life, and\\npreventing long-term complications.\\nBased on patient–provider shared deci-\\nsion-making, insulin pumps may be con-\\nsidered in all pediatric patients with\\ntype 1 diabetes. In particular, pump\\ntherapy may be the preferred mode of\\ninsulin delivery for children under 7\\nyears of age (164). Because of a paucity\\nof data in adolescents and youth with\\ntype 2 diabetes, there is insufﬁcient evi-\\ndence to make recommendations.\\nCommon barriers to pump therapy\\nadoption in children and adolescents\\nare concerns regarding the physical\\ninterference of the device, discomfort\\nwith the idea of having a device on the\\nbody, therapeutic effectiveness, and\\nﬁnancial burden (153,165).\\nAutomated Insulin Delivery Systems\\nAID systems increase and decrease insu-\\nlin delivery based on sensor-derived glu-\\ncose levels to approximate physiologic\\ninsulin delivery. These systems consist\\nof three components: an insulin pump,\\na continuous glucose sensor, and an\\nalgorithm that determines insulin deliv-\\nery. While insulin delivery in closed-loop\\nsystems eventually may be truly auto-\\nmated, currently used hybrid closed-\\nloop systems require entry of carbohy-\\ndrates consumed, and adjustments for\\nexercise must be announced. Multiple\\nstudies, using a variety of systems with\\nvarying algorithms, pump, and sensors,\\nhave been performed in adults and chil-\\ndren (166–175). Evidence suggests AID\\nsystems may reduce A1C levels and\\nimprove TIR (176–180). They may also\\nlower the risk of exercise-related hypo-\\nglycemia (181) and may have psychoso-\\ncial bene ﬁts (182 –184). Use of AID\\nsystems depends on patient preference\\nand selection of patients (and/or care-\\ngivers) who are capable of safely and\\neffectively using the devices.\\nSensor-Augmented Pumps\\nSensor-augmented pumps that suspend\\ninsulin when glucose is low or predicted\\nto go low within the next 30 min have\\nbeen approved by the FDA.

In a different sensor-aug-\\nmented pump, predictive low glucose\\nsuspend reduced time spent with glucose\\n<70 mg/dL from 3.6% at baseline to\\n2.6% (3.2% with sensor-augmented\\npump therapy without predictive low glu-\\ncose suspend) without rebound hypergly-\\ncemia during a 6-week randomized\\ncrossover trial (185). These devices may\\noffer the opportunity to reduce hypogly-\\ncemia for those with a history of noctur-\\nnal hypoglycemia. Additional studies\\nhave been performed, in adults and chil-\\ndren, showing the beneﬁts of this tech-\\nnology (186–188).\\nInsulin Pumps in Patients With Type\\n2 and Other Types of Diabetes\\nTraditional insulin pumps can be consid-\\nered for the treatment of people with\\ntype 2 diabetes who are on MDI as well\\nas those who have other types of diabe-\\ntes resulting in insulin de ﬁciency, for\\ni n s t a n c e ,t h o s ew h oh a v eh a dap a n c r e a -\\ntectomy and/or individuals with cystic\\nﬁbrosis (189–193). Similar to data on\\ninsulin pump use in people with type 1\\ndiabetes, reductions in A1C levels are not\\nconsistently seen in individuals with type\\n2 diabetes when compared with MDI,\\nalthough this has been seen in some\\nstudies (191,194). Use of insulin pumps\\nin insulin-requiring patients with any type\\nof diabetes may improve patient satisfac-\\ntion and simplify therapy (142,189).\\nFor patients judged to be clinically\\ninsulin deﬁcient who are treated with an\\nintensive insulin regimen, the presence\\nor absence of measurable C-peptide lev-\\ne l sd o e sn o tc o r r e l a t ew i t hr e s p o n s et o\\ntherapy (142). Another pump option in\\npeople with type 2 diabetes is a dispos-\\nable patchlike device, which provides a\\ncontinuous, subcutaneous infusion of\\nrapid-acting insulin (basal) as well as 2-\\nunit increments of bolus insulin at the\\npress of a button (190,192,195,196). Use\\nof an insulin pump as a means for insulin\\ndelivery is an individual choice for people\\nwith diabetes and should be considered\\nan option in patients who are capable of\\nsafely using the device.\\nDo-It-Yourself Closed-Loop Systems\\nRecommendation\\n7.27 Individual patients may be\\nusing systems not approved by\\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Admin-\\nistration, such as do-it-yourself\\nclosed-loop systems and\\nothers; providers cannot pre-\\nscribe these systems but\\nshould assist in diabetes man-\\nagement to ensure patient\\nsafety.E\\nSome people with type 1 diabetes have\\nbeen using“do-it-yourself” (DIY) systems\\nthat combine a pump and an rtCGM\\nwith a controller and an algorithm\\ndesigned to automate insulin delivery\\n(197–200). These systems are not\\napproved by the FDA, although there are\\nefforts underway to obtain regulatory\\napproval for them. The information on\\nhow to set up and manage these systems\\nis freely available on the internet, and\\nthere are internet groups where people\\ninform each other as to how to set up\\nand use them. Although these systems\\ncannot be prescribed by providers, it is\\nimportant to keep patients safe if they\\nare using these methods for automated\\ninsulin delivery. Part of this entails mak-\\ning sure people have a“backup plan” in\\ncase of pump failure. Additionally, in\\nmost DIY systems, insulin doses are\\nadjusted based on the pump settings for\\nbasal rates, carbohydrate ratios, correc-\\ntion doses, and insulin activity. Therefore,\\nthese settings can be evaluated and\\nchanged based on the patient’si n s u l i n\\nrequirements.\\nDigital Health Technology\\nRecommendation\\n7.28 Systems that combine tech-\\nnology and online coaching\\ncan be beneﬁcial in treating\\nprediabetes and diabetes for\\nsome individuals. B\\nIncreasingly, people are turning to the\\ninternet for advice, coaching, connection,\\nand health care. Diabetes, in part\\nbecause it is both common and numeric,\\nlends itself to the development of apps\\nand online programs. Recommendations\\nfor developing and implementing a digital\\ndiabetes clinic have been published\\n(201). The FDA approves and monitors\\nclinically validated, digital, usually online,\\nhealth technologies intended to treat a\\nmedical or psychological condition; these\\nare known as digital therapeutics or\\n“digiceuticals” (202). Other applications,\\nsuch as those that assist in displaying or\\nstoring data, encourage a healthy lifestyle\\nor provide limited clinical data support.\\nTherefore, it is possible toﬁnd apps that\\nhave been fully reviewed and approved\\nand others designed and promoted\\nby people with relatively little skill or\\nknowledge in the clinical treatment of\\ndiabetes.\\nAn area of particular importance is\\nthat of online privacy and security.\\nThere are established cloud-based data\\ncollection programs, such as Tidepool,\\nGlooko, and others, that have been\\ndeveloped with appropriate data secu-\\nrity features and are compliant with the\\nU.S. Health Insurance Portability and\\nAccountability Act of 1996. These pro-\\ngrams can be useful for monitoring\\npatients, both by the patients them-\\nselves as well as their health care team\\n(203). Consumers should read the policy\\nregarding data privacy and sharing\\nbefore entering data into an application\\nand learn how they can control the way\\ntheir data will be used (some programs\\noffer the ability to share more or less\\ninformation, such as being part of a reg-\\nistry or data repository or not).\\nThere are many online programs that\\noffer lifestyle counseling to aid with\\nweight loss and increase physical activity\\n(204). Many of these include a health\\ncoach and can create small groups of\\nsimilar patients in social networks. There\\nare programs that aim to treat prediabe-\\ntes and prevent progression to diabetes,\\noften following the model of the Diabe-\\ntes Prevention Program (205,206). Others\\nassist in improving diabetes outcomes by\\nremotely monitoring patient clinical data\\n(for instance, wireless monitoring of glu-\\ncose levels, weight, or blood pressure)\\nand providing feedback and coaching\\n(207–212). There are text messaging\\napproaches that tie into a variety of dif-\\nferent types of lifestyle and treatment\\nprograms, which vary in terms of their\\neffectiveness (213,214). For many of\\nthese interventions, there are limited RCT\\ndata and long-term follow-up is lacking.\\nHowever, for an individual patient, opting\\ninto one of these programs can be helpful\\nand, for many, is an attractive option.\\ncare.diabetesjournals.org Diabetes Technology S105\\nDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/45/Supplement_1/S97/637511/dc22s007.pdf by guest on 14 November 2022'),\n",

INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION \\n4\\n“Within a care home environment \\nwhere advancing age, chronic \\ndisease, frailty and disability \\nconcentrate among residents; \\ndiabetes imposes an extra health \\nburden that stretches the capacity \\nand skills of many care staff beyond \\ntheir ability and it is no wonder that \\nhospital admissions result”\\nProfessor Allan Sinclair\\nForeword\\nOver the last decade, there have been many great advances in \\ndiabetes care. These have been supported by multiple national \\ninitiatives and various evidence-based guidelines, including \\nthe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), \\nthe National Service Framework for Diabetes and not least the \\ninclusion of diabetes in the Quality and Outcomes Framework \\nin Primary Care. \\nIn spite of this, improvement in caring for residents with \\ndiabetes in care home settings has not been as forthcoming. \\nIt is important to recognise that all adults living with diabetes \\ndeserve to receive the same standard of care whether they live \\nin their own home or a residential/nursing care setting. The \\navailable evidence suggests that although some good clinical \\npractice exists, many care providers do not have adequate \\ntraining provision for staff or follow good practice guidelines \\nor accountability for the quality-of-care residents with diabetes \\nreceive.\\nDiabetes in Care Homes (Diabetes UK, 2010) revealed a lack \\nof screening for diabetes on admission (less than a quarter of \\nhomes) to care homes and only one third screen for diabetes \\nannually. The findings estimate that the number of residents \\nliving with undiagnosed diabetes may be at least 13,500 in the \\nUK. If we combine this with the number currently diagnosed, \\nthere is a significant number of people whose diabetes \\ncare needs are not being met due to a lack of staff training, \\nawareness and screening. It is estimated, a resident with \\ndiabetes is admitted to a hospital every 25 minutes and unless \\nmeasures are put in place to address these issues, by 2051, one \\nresident with diabetes from a care home will be admitted every \\n10 minutes.\\nThe Northwest Coast Diabetes Health Inequalities Programme \\nrecognised that the standards of care might vary between \\ndifferent populations and communities, therefore focus should \\nbe aimed towards improving care for those groups likely to \\nexperience greater diabetes health inequalities by essentially \\nsupporting improvement, delivery and standards in diabetes \\ncare. These guidelines have been developed with the objective \\nof improving exactly those standards of care for all care homes \\nwithin the Fountains Integrated Care Home Service.\\nJoseph McGoldrick\\nJoseph McGoldrick\\nFICHS Diabetes Project Manager \\nRegistered Dietitian\\nHealthbox CIC'),\n",

Why diabetes\\ncare is important\\nIn 2013, The International Diabetes Federation \\nrecognised that the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes \\nincreases with age and Diabetes doubles the risk \\nof admission to a care home. Therefore, with an \\nincreasing aging population in care settings, comes \\nthe need for high quality care to safely manage their \\ncondition (Diabetes UK, 2010).\\nApproximately 1-in-4 residents may have diabetes \\nin the care home setting and the same number may \\nhave undiagnosed diabetes. Often the diagnosis may \\nbe missed or undiagnosed when symptoms are non-\\nspecific or attributed to age, especially in residents \\nwith dementia, learning difficulties/disabilities and \\nmental health needs. The opportunities for early \\nintervention may be missed with delayed/missed \\ndiagnosis. Moreover, with existing co-morbidities \\nand related treatments, diabetes in older adults is \\npotentially more complex.\\n• Kidney disease – diabetes is the single-most cause of end-\\nstage kidney disease requiring dialysis or transplant.\\n• Cardiovascular disease – heart failure being the most \\ncommon and fatal complication.\\n• Retinopathy - People with diabetes have nearly a 50% \\nincreased risk of developing glaucoma, especially if they \\nalso have high blood pressure, and up to a threefold \\nincreased risk of developing cataracts, both of which can \\nalso lead to blindness.\\n• Diabetic neuropathy - if poorly controlled, can damage \\nthe nerves, muscles, sweat glands and circulation in the \\nfeet and legs leading to foot ulcers and amputations. \\nDiabetes is the most common cause of lower limb \\namputations with over 135 amputations a week amongst \\npeople with diabetes. Many amputations are preceded \\nby foot ulceration caused by a combination of impaired \\ncirculation and nerve damage.\\nThe complications associated with residents living with diabetes \\ninclude an increased risk of:\\n• Heart attack & Stroke\\n• Pressure Ulcer/Delayed Wound Healing\\n• Chest/Urine & Skin Infections\\n• Stroke\\n• Reduced Cognitive and Physical Function\\n• Hospital Admission/Readmission\\nAlso, with impaired cognitive function or increased levels of \\npain and depression, may infer an inability to self-manage or \\nreport symptoms, such as those associated with hypoglycaemia.\\nDiabetes is considered to be the fastest rising health concern \\nwe face in the UK, with approximately 4 million people \\ndiagnosed, and a new diagnosis every 2 minutes (Diabetes \\nUK, 2016). Good management of blood glucose levels can \\nreduce the associated complications, however, when poor \\nmanagement occurs, serious adverse events may ensue, \\nincluding:\\n(Diabetes UK: Facts and Stats (2015)\\nAvailable at: https://www.diabetes.org.uk/professionals/\\nposition-statements-reports/statistics'),\n",

Insulin (key) attaches itself to the \\ncell wall (lock) to unlock the cells, allowing glucose to \\nbe transported from the blood and into the cell where \\nit can be used as fuel for energy in the body.\\nWhen this mechanism breaks down in both Type 1 and 2 \\nDiabetes, the body is unable to control blood glucose levels \\nand unless lifestyle and/or medication interventions are \\nimplemented, blood glucose will remain dysregulated.\\nIf blood glucose levels remain chronically high (hyperglycaemia), \\nover time this can cause damage to cells, blood vessels and \\norgans, leading to complications.\\nThese may include:\\n• Damage to the eyes, which can cause visual problems \\n(retinopathy) and sometimes blindness\\n• Damage to the kidneys (nephropathy)\\n• Damage to the nerves including those supplying the legs, \\nfeet, stomach, kidneys and the organs within the body \\n(neuropathy)\\n• Damage to the heart, blood vessels and brain which can \\nlead to heart attacks and strokes (cardiovascular)\\nPeople with Type 2 diabetes are at a very high risk of \\ndeveloping cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and \\nstrokes.

WHAT IS DIABETES?\\n2.2 Types of Diabetes\\nThere are several types of diabetes. For the purposes of these \\nguidelines, the two main types discussed are Type 1 diabetes \\nand Type 2 diabetes and will be the focus. Type 2 diabetes is \\nmore prevalent in older adults; therefore, it is likely that there \\nwill be higher numbers of people in care homes with this type \\nof diabetes. Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes have distinct \\ndifferences and characteristics, these are summarised in the \\ntable below.\\nThe table illustrates that Type 1 Diabetes tends to have an \\nearlier onset and occurs in people under 40. Type 1 Diabetes \\naccounts for approximately 10% of all diabetes cases in the UK \\nand is characterised by no insulin production by the pancreas, \\ntherefore individuals will require lifelong regular insulin \\ninjections/pumps to manage their blood glucose levels.\\nIn Type 2 Diabetes, onset mostly occurs in adults over 40; \\nhowever, there are increasing cases of children developing \\nthis type of diabetes. Type 2 Diabetes is most prevalent in \\nthe care home setting and probably the most likely for you to \\nencounter. At diagnosis, individuals with Type 2 Diabetes are \\nencouraged to make changes to their diet and lifestyle in order \\nto control their blood glucose levels. In addition, depending on \\ntheir HbA1c levels, people may be prescribed a first-line oral \\nmedication called Metformin. This is often succeeded by further \\nmedications depending on the progression of the condition. If \\noral medications do not control blood glucose levels, residents \\nmay need to be started on an insulin regimen. If a resident \\nprogress to insulin, this does not change their diagnosis to Type \\n1 Diabetic, but rather they are an ‘insulin-dependent Type 2 \\nDiabetic’\\nRegardless of the type of diabetes our residents are living with, \\nthey are at risk of developing associated complications, which \\nmay be life-threatening. Therefore, it is important that each \\nresident has a regularly reviewed, person-centred care plan to \\nbest manage their condition.\\n2.0. WHAT IS DIABETES?\\nKEY POINTS\\n• Diabetes is a long-term, complex condition characterised \\nby high blood glucose levels and several associated \\ncomplications\\n• Type 2 diabetes is more prevalent in care homes\\n• A diagnosis of diabetes MUST be documented in the \\nresident’s diabetes passport/care plan and notes\\n• Residents MUST be screened for diabetes on admission to \\nthe home and at two yearly intervals, please discuss with \\nthe resident’s GP\\n2.3. Screening for Diabetes\\nCompared with the general population, there is \\na higher incidence of diabetes and undiagnosed \\ndiabetes in the care home setting; therefore, it is \\nrecommended that residents should be screened for \\ndiabetes on admission and every 2 years thereafter by \\nthe GP (IDF , 2013 & Diabetes UK, 2010).\\nNB. It is important that this is discussed with the FICHS \\nGP and the date and frequency is documented in the \\nresidents’ care plan/diabetes passport (see appendix \\n1) and case notes. In addition, care staff should be \\naware of the signs and symptoms of diabetes, as \\nsome residents may present with these but not have a \\nformal diagnosis. Also, it is important to recognise that \\nresidents may not be able to articulate (depending on \\nprogression of dementia) signs and symptoms, making \\nthe awareness of care staff even more pertinent.\\nThese include:\\n• Increased thirst\\n• Passing more urine than normal, especially at \\nnight\\n• Blurred vision\\n• Recurrent infections, especially genital thrush\\n• Cuts and wounds may take longer to heal\\n• Tiredness and sleeping more than normal\\n• Weight loss\\nPlease alert the FICHS GP if any of the above \\nsymptoms are present and the resident is not known to \\nhave diabetes so that screening can then take place.\\nFigure 1: Differences between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.

You MUST ensure the correct insulin is \\nused and corresponding insulin pen device, by checking the \\nresident’s identification is confirmed as correct and that the \\ninsulin is in date. \\n• Once in use the insulin should be kept at room temperature for \\nup to 30 days, or as per manufacturer’s instructions, not in the \\nfridge. Only unused insulin pens or vials should be kept in the \\nfridge and away from the freezer compartment. \\n• Ensure a new insulin needle is used for each injection. DO NOT \\nleave the needle on the pen after use, dispose of this in the \\nsharps bin. \\n• Ensure the insulin pen is primed before each use – dial 2 units \\non the pen and dispel the units into the sink (known as the ‘air \\nshot’). Look for a bead of insulin at the end of the pen.  If this is \\nmissing, repeat the 2 unit ‘air shot’. If after repeated priming no \\ninsulin is seen at the end of the pen DO NOT use the pen.\\n• If residents are on a mixed or cloudy insulin ensure the insulin is \\nmixed prior to use. Gently invert the pen for 10 times and roll \\nthe pen for 10 times until the insulin looks white not cloudy. DO \\nNOT shake the insulin as this will affect the insulin molecules. \\n• Check the resident’s injection sites at regular intervals for any \\nlumpy areas. You may need to palpate the injection sites with \\nyour hands as the lumps may be underneath the skin. If there \\nare any lumpy areas do not inject into these and avoid this area. \\n• Ensure the insulin is given at the appropriate times. For rapid \\nacting and mixed insulin these need to be given with meals. \\n• DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES withdraw insulin \\nfrom a pre-filled insulin pen or insulin cartridge with a syringe. \\nThis can have fatal consequences for the resident. Insulin may \\nonly be withdrawn from an insulin vial using an appropriate \\nprescribed insulin syringe and needle, and only as directed by \\nthe GP or diabetes specialist team.\\nKEY POINTS\\nPlease ensure to consider the following points when administering \\ninsulin injections: \\nHow to roll (A) and invert (B) the insulin pen prior to use.

If too little carbohydrates are eaten by \\nresidents who are prescribed insulin or sulphonylurea tablets \\n(e.g., gliclazide) hypoglycaemia can ensue. Reducing the risk of \\nhypoglycaemia should be a particular aim for these residents \\n(NICE, 2015a). \\nThe portion of carbohydrate consumed is the key component \\naffecting blood glucose levels (American Diabetes Association \\n(ADA), 2004a, 2004b; Diabetes UK Nutrition Working Group, \\n2011) i.e., the greater the serving of starch and sugar containing \\nfoods and drinks consumed, the higher the blood glucose \\nlevels will rise. It is important to note, most foods comprising \\ncarbohydrate from starch or natural sugars also offer the body \\nwith other important nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, \\nfibre, protein; however, the majority of foods/drinks containing \\nadded sugars are low in nutrients and have a negative impact \\non dental health (Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition \\n(SACN) 2015). Consequently, while people with diabetes \\ncan include some sugar containing foods in place of other \\ncarbohydrates, as part of a balanced diet (Diabetes UK \\nNutrition Working Group, 2011; IDF , 2013), everyone (with/\\nwithout diabetes) is advised to reduce the intake of added \\nsugars (SACN, 2015) and caution should be exercised to avoid \\nexcess energy intake (NICE, 2015a).\\nCARBOHYDRATES ARE FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING FOODS AND DRINKS\\n*Also contains starch e.g., flour'),\n",

DIET & DIABETES\\n4.3 Approaches to \\nreduce added sugar in \\nresidents’ diet\\n• Consider offering sugar-free, no added sugar or diet \\nsquashes/fizzy drinks instead of full sugar varieties.\\n• Avoid/limit adding sugar to hot drinks, consider offering \\nsweeteners as a replacement.\\n• When baking/cooking, reduce the amount of sugar \\nadded, frequently the quantity specified in a recipe can \\nbe halved without having a negative impact on the final \\nproduct. Also, some recipes lend themselves well to \\nsweeteners as a substitute.\\n• Reduce portion sizes/frequency of sugar sweetened \\nproducts\\nThere is no need for a ‘special diabetic diet’ (TREND-UK, 2010; \\nIDOP , 2013) or ‘diabetic foods’ (Diabetes UK, 2010; Diabetes UK \\nNutrition Working Group, 2011; NICE, 2015a). Diabetic foods \\nprovide no benefit to individuals with diabetes. They may still \\naffect blood glucose levels, often contain just as much fat and \\nenergy as the regular varieties, often have a laxative effect and \\nare more expensive (Diabetes UK, 2010; Diabetes UK Nutrition \\nWorking Group, 2011).\\nThe most important factor is to make sure portions of starchy \\nand natural sugar containing foods are not excessive. When \\noffering carbohydrates, encourage slower release (lower \\nGlycaemic index (GI)) (NICE, 2015a) as they may have an \\nadditional benefit for blood glucose levels (Brand-Miller et \\nal., 2003; ADA, 2004a, 2004b; Opperman et al., 2004; Thomas \\n& Elliott, 2009; Thomas & Elliott, 2010; Diabetes UK Nutrition \\nWorking Group, 2011). Most slower releasing carbohydrates are \\nless processed and higher in fibre.\\nExamples of low GI slow releasing carbohydrates include:\\n• Vegetables/salad vegetables\\n• Most fruits\\n• Pulses (peas, beans, lentils)\\n• Oats (e.g., porridge, natural muesli, oat-based bread), \\nAll-Bran\\n• Grainy/seeded/stone ground bread\\n• New potatoes, sweet potato (with skin on) \\n• Pasta (wholegrain versions are lower GI)\\n• Basmati or easy cook rice (wholegrain versions are the \\nbest choice) \\nServing size of carbohydrate foods is still the biggest factor \\naffecting blood glucose levels (Diabetes UK Nutrition Working \\nGroup, 2011). Regular nutritional screening of residents by care \\nhome staff with appropriate skills and training is also important \\nto identify malnutrition – (Care Quality Commission (CQC), \\n2014; NICE, 2006; 2012) For homes in the FICHS, it is important \\nto follow the MUST care pathway and implement all relevant \\nsteps. Keep food record charts to monitor carbohydrate intake, \\nprimarily when reviewed in combination with blood glucose \\nrecords for any residents who have their levels monitored.\\n4.4. Diabetic residents \\nidentified as \\noverweight or obese\\nLosing weight is the biggest predictor for reducing the risk \\nof developing Type 2 Diabetes in those who are at high risk \\n(Hamman et al., 2006; Diabetes UK Nutrition Working Group, \\n2011) and should be the primary diabetes management \\nstrategy in those with Type 2 diabetes who are overweight/\\nobese (Diabetes UK Nutrition Working Group, 2011). Residents \\nwho are functionally independent should be supported to \\nachieve a healthy body weight (IDF , 2013).\\nAn initial aim of 5-10% weight loss is recommended (NICE, \\n2015a), and is associated with a reduced risk of developing \\nType 2 diabetes (Diabetes UK Nutrition Working Group, 2011), \\nreduction in blood pressure (Feldstein et al., 2008; Diabetes UK \\nNutrition Working Group, 2011), cholesterol levels, improved \\nblood glucose levels and reduction in mortality (Williamson \\net al., 2000). Weight loss should be achieved through long \\nterm lifestyle changes (ideally changes to diet and increase in \\nphysical activity levels where possible). Specific goals should \\nbe identified and negotiated as part of the care planning \\nprocess. An initial weight loss target of 5-10% is advised. \\nLower amounts of weight loss may still be of benefit and in the \\nlonger-term greater weight loss to achieve a healthy weight will \\nhave benefits (NICE, 2015a). The focus for weight management \\nshould be on total energy intake rather than on the source \\nof energy in the diet as there is insufficient evidence for best \\ndietary approach (Franz et al., 2010; Diabetes UK Nutrition \\nWorking Group, 2011; Wheeler et al., 2011; Ajala et al., 2013).\\nDietary changes may include:\\n• A reduction in portion sizes, particularly of high fat/\\nsugar processed foods (e.g., cakes, biscuits, crisps, etc.) \\nand starchy foods at meals (bread, rice, potatoes, pasta, \\ncereal). Use of a smaller plate can facilitate this\\n• Increased vegetable/salad portions (low in calories and \\nhigh in fibre)\\n• Reduction in snacking. (In rare circumstances a diabetes \\nspecialist may advise that a resident requires snacks to \\nprevent hypoglycaemia if on certain insulin regimens).\\nIf snacks are included encourage lower calorie and \\ncarbohydrate options e.g., salad vegetables cut into \\nbatons; single handful fruit; small serving of yoghurt; plain \\nbiscuit e.g., cracker, Nice, Rich Tea, Marie\\n• Reducing intake of high fat and refined carbohydrate/\\nsugar foods such as cakes, chocolate, biscuits, puddings, \\ncrisps, sugary drinks, sweets, etc\\n• Reducing added sugar intake (see above)'),\n",

Dietary provision, which is non-invasive and optimises \\nnutritional and fluid intake, should be a priority (Diabetes \\nUK Nutrition Working Group, 2011). Nutrition should be \\npersonalised to the resident’s overall condition, not focused \\nsolely on their diabetes (Diabetes UK, 2013a; 2013b). If palliative \\ncare residents request ‘sugary’ foods these should be provided, \\nwith diabetes medication being adjusted as required (Diabetes \\nUK, 2013b).\\nMalnutrition is common in older adults, particularly in care \\nsettings (British Association of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition \\n(BAPEN), 2015) and diabetes is known to increase the risk of \\nunder-nutrition (Diabetes UK Nutrition Working Group, 2010).\\nMalnutrition is associated with longer and more frequent \\nhospital admissions, increased mortality, pressure ulcers, \\ndelirium, and depression. Possible causes of malnutrition \\ninclude:\\n• Poor appetite\\n• Altered taste and smell\\n• Swallowing difficulties\\n• Oral and dental problems (It is estimated that people \\nwith diabetes can be up to approximately three times \\nmore likely to develop gum disease than people without \\ndiabetes). Functional impairments\\n• Low mood\\n• Reduced cognition\\nFor residents who are malnourished or who are at risk of \\nmalnutrition, healthy eating changes may be unsuitable \\nas they may result in weight loss.

BLOOD GLUCOSE CONTROL & HBA1C \\n5.3. HbA1c & Frailty\\nDIABETES AND FRAILTY\\nEmerging evidence suggests frailty and sarcopenia (age-related \\nlean muscle loss characterised by loss of power) are recognised \\nas new complications of diabetes in older adults (Sinclair, 2017); \\nand, Type 2 Diabetes has been identified as a risk factor for \\nthe development of frailty and sarcopenia. Therefore, priority \\nshould be given to strategize how to implement preventative \\nmeasures to reduce these risk factors in residents with diabetes. \\nSince regular physical activity and optimising nutrition are key \\naspects in reducing risk, implementation of these should be \\nprioritised in our residents’ care plan and may have significant \\nadvantages in delaying or preventing these associated \\ncomplications. \\nIn 2017, The National Collaborative Stakeholder on Frailty \\nin Diabetes published a position statement to provide a \\nframework for action in managing older adults with diabetes \\nand frailty (Sinclair et al., 2017). The document highlights five \\nkey messages to address the issues of frailty in diabetes:\\n1. Understand that frailty is a serious but avoidable \\ncomplication of diabetes \\nDiabetes increases the risk of the development of frailty, \\nwhich is associated with hypertension, renal impairment \\nand dementia. Diabetes may decrease mobility and restrict \\nactivities of daily living (ADL) by approximately 50-80%, \\nwhich increases with age (Wong, 2013).\\n2. Be aware of the shortfalls of current international \\nguidance \\nSeveral well received international guidelines have been \\ndeveloped, however have been criticised for being \\ndeveloped for specialist interventions, which lack practical \\ntranslation to varied primary care settings. The evidence \\nhas been reviewed, to provide realistic glycaemic targets \\nwhich align with specific categories of frailty (Strain, 2018).\\n3. Use simple methods to detect frailty and assess \\nfunctional status \\nThe Electronic Frailty Index (EFI), together with a 4-meter \\ngait score and a timed get-up-and-go test are invaluable \\ntools in the assessment of frailty in primary care.\\n4. Tailor goals of care with measures of frailty status \\nIt was acknowledged that there are increasing concerns \\nof polypharmacy in older adults with diabetes which \\nincreases the personal and public burden (GP , ambulance \\ncall outs and hospitalisations) of hypoglycaemia and \\nthe lack of individualised targets for frail older adults. A \\nconsensus view recommends few diabetic individuals aged \\n70 years and over benefit from intensive blood glucose \\ntargets of less than 53 mmol/mol, as available evidence \\ndoes not support these targets. Whereas, a more relaxed \\ntarget range of between 53-58mmol/mol for reasonable \\nfunctionality; 64mmol/mol for moderate to severe frailty \\nand a HbA1c target of 70mmol/mol for severe frailty \\n(Strain, 2018).\\n5. Take specific actions to improve patient outcomes. \\nPractical action should be taken in the management of \\nolder adults with diabetes and frailty:\\n• Older adults with diabetes over the age of 65 should be \\nassessed for frailty and severity using EFI tool, together \\nwith a 4-meter gait score and a timed get-up-and-go test\\n• HbA1c targets should be safe, sensible and appropriate – \\nwith the aim of keeping residents free of adverse events, \\nmaintain optimal quality of life, well-being and functional \\nstatus\\n• Residents with diabetes and frailty should have their \\nmedications reviewed regularly and a de-escalation \\napproach adopted where appropriate\\n• Even though there are no restrictions on glucose lowering \\nagents in frail older adults with diabetes, care should \\nbe taken when assessing the need for longer-acting \\nsulfonylureas, complex insulin regimens, undernutrition, \\nresidents in care homes and severe frailty, all of which \\nincrease the risk of hypoglycaemia\\n• Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone) and SGLT-2 inhibitors \\nshould be limited in moderate-to-severe frailty due to \\nthe adverse side-effects of unintentional weight loss, \\ndehydration and possible amputations (NICE, 2018). In \\naddition, GLP-1 receptor agonists may cause unintentional \\nweight loss and anorexia, therefore great caution should \\nbe exercised\\n• The FICHS in collaboration with care homes and the wider \\ndiabetes service should consider implementation of the \\nfrailty diabetes pathway to address frailty, multimorbidity \\nand cognitive impairment for diabetes residents\\n• Care staff and healthcare professionals who are involved \\nin the management of diabetic residents should receive \\ntraining to upskill in the area of frailty and functional \\nstatus to deliver optimal care'),\n",

DIABETES AND DEMENTIA7.0. DIABETES AND DEMENTIA\\nEARLY DIABETES DIAGNOSIS IS \\nIMPORTANT IN DEMENTIA\\nPeople living with dementia may be unable to recognise the \\nsigns and symptoms of diabetes, which can be compounded \\nfurther by an inability to articulate the presenting symptoms. \\nOften, infections such as urinary tract infections and thrush are \\nthe only signs residents have diabetes.\\nPeople with diabetes are encouraged to manage the condition \\nthemselves so diagnosing dementia in people who have \\ndiabetes will lead to difficulties with self-management and \\nadherence with medication, including giving themselves insulin \\ninjections safely. Having both conditions may mean agreeing to \\nhigher targets for blood glucose and blood pressure to keep \\npeople safe, and help the person and their family to make \\nsensible decisions about the future.\\nDiagnosing diabetes early in residents who have dementia will \\nensure they receive regular review and management of the risk \\nfactors that can lead to developing diabetes complications, \\ntherefore are identified quickly and treated as required. If \\nnecessary, medications can be started to relieve the symptoms \\nof high blood glucose which will improve quality of life (e.g. \\nreduce tiredness, frequency of urination, thirst) and avoid \\nhospital admissions for very high blood glucose levels.\\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA AND DEMENTIA\\nPeople with dementia may not be able to recognise symptoms \\nof hypoglycaemia (see section 9), therefore care staff need to \\nbe vigilant. If hypoglycaemia is not treated, the person may \\nfall, lose consciousness, choke and can trigger a stroke or heart \\nattack. \\nAgree safe blood glucose targets which aim to avoid \\nsymptomatic high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) \\nbut avoid low blood glucose levels (hypoglycaemia). Oral \\nmedications which cause hypoglycaemia (sulphonylureas) \\nshould be avoided where possible. Ensure regular meals and \\nsnacks are provided for people who use insulin.\\nDIABETES CARE IN DEMENTIA\\nPeople living with diabetes for several years may be skilled \\nat managing their own insulin injections and monitoring \\nblood glucose levels, however, the onset of dementia may \\ncompromise these skills. People with dementia who develop \\ndiabetes may appear to have a worsening of their dementia \\nbecause of the diabetes symptoms.\\n7.2 Supporting a \\nresident living with \\ndementia and diabetes\\nDementia is an umbrella term for people suffering \\nfrom a range of neurological disorders which result in \\ncognitive impairment, memory loss and compromised \\nmotor skills. There are more than 100 types of \\ndementia, the most common being Alzheimers, \\nhowever people will also be familiar with vascular \\ndementia, Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Lewy body \\ndementia. It is a progressive disease where the \\ncondition worsens over time and the person may \\nstruggle with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), become \\ndisorientated and have difficulty managing social \\nsituations. Signs and symptoms of dementia vary from \\nperson to person and usually get worse over time. \\nEarly symptoms include forgetfulness, repetitiveness, \\nshort-term memory loss, and difficulty in finding the \\nright words.\\nLINK BETWEEN DIABETES AND DEMENTIA\\nThere is a doubling of risk associated for people living with \\ndiabetes developing dementia. Whereas people without \\ndiabetes, there risk is approximately 1 in 10. The reasons for this \\nare not fully understood, however is likely to be multifactorial, \\nincluding: \\n• High blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) can damage \\nthe cells and blood vessels in the brain\\n• When blood vessels in the brain are damaged, brain cells \\nmay not get enough oxygen and nutrients to function \\nproperly and may die\\n• Insulin resistance causes the body to produce higher \\nlevels of insulin to try to keep blood glucose levels within \\nthe normal range. The high levels of insulin can cause \\ndamage to blood vessels and cells in the brain\\n• Diabetes may contribute to the build-up of proteins \\nin the brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The \\nresearch that links diabetes and dementia often does not \\ndistinguish between diabetes types and it is not clear \\nif the increased risk of dementia is the same for people \\nwith type 1 diabetes. However, since anyone can develop \\ndementia, the information in this toolkit about early \\nsymptoms and reducing the risk of dementia may also be \\nhelpful when supporting people with type 1 diabetes\\nISSUES FOR PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA\\nWHO DEVELOP DIABETE\\nISSUES FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES\\nWHO DEVELOP DEMENTIA\\n• Developing incontinence as they need to pass urine \\nmore often but not able to find the toilet.\\n• Increased risk of falls due to more frequent visit to \\nthe toilet\\n• Increased confusion if blood glucose levels are high \\nand causing dehydration\\n• Distress if usual diet changed significantly\\n• Distress, wandering, rocking movements, crying if \\nthey have pain and are unable to put this into word\\n• Forgetting to take medications regularly\\n• Forgetting they have taken medication so at risk of \\ndouble dosing\\n• Forgetting how to do injections\\n• Unable to make decisions about interpreting blood \\nglucose results such as adjusting insulin doses or \\ntreating hypoglycaemia\\n• Missing meals and drinks so at risk of low blood \\nglucose levels and dehydration\\n• Forgetting they have eaten and at risk of high \\nglucose levels if they eat again'),\n",

Practical support\\nOffering practical support to residents living with dementia \\nand diabetes may be determined by scope of practice and job \\nrole. However, expanding your knowledge-base regardless of \\nyour role will be helpful for your understanding to share with \\nresidents, their family and friends.\\nWhere appropriate, you should encourage, enable and \\nsupport residents to self-manage their diabetes. Daily diabetes \\nmanagement will involve a careful balance between food, \\nmedication, physical activity and blood glucose monitoring (for \\ninsulin/sulfonylurea dependent residents) and symptoms of \\ndementia can make this increasingly difficult.\\nEarly-onset of dementia, residents may still be able to manage \\ndaily tasks by following simple, regular routines by adopting \\nstrategies to remember e.g. written reminders, or timed alarms \\nfor blood glucose monitoring and or medications. As disease \\nprogression ensues, daily self-management may become \\nincreasingly challenging and care home staff  may need to \\nsupport residents with these tasks. \\nWhen supporting residents to complete daily tasks, make sure \\nto ask their permission to assist them and if possible support \\nthem to do it themselves. Remember, even if residents are \\nunable to do the task independently, they can still be involved \\nto a certain degree. For example, with supervision, they may \\nbe able to perform their own  finger prick test or observe with \\ndiscussion.\\nIt can be difficult for residents with dementia to relinquish their \\nindependence and accept support from others. In addition, \\nthey may not remember why they need an insulin injection or \\nhave their finger prick test and often become fearful of the \\ninvasiveness. If resistance occurs with diabetes care, reassure \\nthe resident by validating their feelings, keep a calm tone \\nand demeanor and explain what you are doing and why it is \\nimportant. If the resident becomes agitated or upset, give them \\nspace, allow them to calm down before approaching again to \\ncomplete the task.\\nBLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING\\nBlood glucose levels that are very low (hypoglycaemia - see \\nsection 9) or very high (hyperglycaemia - see section 10) may \\ncause further damage to the brain. If a person with diabetes has \\ndementia, they will need increasing support in monitoring and \\nmanaging their blood glucose levels. A resident with dementia \\nwill find it difficult to identify symptoms of high or low blood \\nglucose, furthermore this is compounded by an inability to \\narticulate to care staff if they are experiencing symptoms. Staff \\nsupporting a person with dementia and diabetes need to learn \\nhow to recognise the signs and symptoms (see relevant sections \\nabove) and know what treatment is required. Some residents \\nwith diabetes may need to check their blood glucose levels \\ndaily or several times a day, particularly if they use insulin. \\nSUPPORTING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY\\nResidents with diabetes and dementia should be encouraged \\nand supported to continue physical activity for as long as \\npossible. Where physical activity is encouraged and maintained \\nin the early stages of dementia, it is more likely to be \\nmaintained as the condition progresses. Care should be taken \\nif a resident hasn’t been physically active for some time, and \\ntheir FICHS GP should be consulted prior to implementing any \\nexercise regime. To avoid risk of injury, ensure good supervision \\nis available and that the person wears appropriate clothes. \\nGood foot care is very important for people with diabetes, \\nso the person should wear appropriate footwear for physical \\nactivity and should regularly visit a podiatrist. Participation in \\nphysical activity will affect the person’s blood glucose level, and \\nif the person uses insulin or sulfonylureas, increasing physical \\nactivity may increase their risk of a hypo: \\n• Before doing any physical activity the person’s blood \\nglucose level (for residents on hypo-inducing medications) \\nshould be checked\\n• If blood glucose is low, they will need to eat something \\nbefore they start the activity to avoid  hypoglycaemia\\n• After finishing the activity, check blood glucose levels \\nagain\\n• If a hypo does occur, this should be treated promptly\\n• Caution should also be taken with physical activity if blood \\nsugar levels are very high (more than 15 mmol/L)'),\n",

MANAGEMENT OF HYPOGL YCAEMIA (LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE)9.0. MANAGEMENT OF HYPOGL YCAEMIA (LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE)\\n9.3. How to treat \\nhypoglycaemia\\nSTEP ONE\\nIt is recommended that 15-20g of fast acting carbohydrates \\nare required to treat a hypoglycaemic event (TREND UK, 2011). \\nSuitable treatments include:\\n• 100ml of LucozadeTM ** (see note below)\\n• Small NON-DIET fizzy drink (approx. 150ml)\\n• 200ml (a small carton) of smooth fresh orange juice, NOT \\norange cordial or diluted squash drinks\\n• Five or six dextrose tablets\\n• Four large jelly babies\\n• Seven to eight large jelly beans\\n• One to two tubes of glucose gel (Glucogel), usually \\nprescribed by GP\\n**Check the label of Lucozade for nutritional content of \\ncarbohydrate per 100ml. If the label states carbohydrate per \\n100ml, 17.8g gives the resident 100mls of Lucozade. If the \\nlabel states carbohydrate per 100ml, 8.9g gives the resident \\n200mls of Lucozade (just over half a bottle).\\nThe above treatments may only be used if the resident can \\nswallow. Please DO NOT give residents any of the above \\ntreatments if they cannot swallow or have swallowing difficulties \\nas they may choke. Residents who are known to have \\nswallowing difficulties will need to be referred to the dietetic \\nteam if they are at risk of hypoglycaemia to discuss suitable \\nhypo treatments. The choice of hypo treatment for each \\nresident should be documented in their care plan and medical \\ncase notes and staff should be aware of this.\\nSTEP TWO\\nAfter one of the above recommended treatments has been \\ngiven, recheck the resident’s blood glucose again after 10-15 \\nminutes. If the blood glucose level remains below 4mmols \\nrepeat one of the above hypo treatments again but only if the \\nresident can swallow. Recheck the resident’s blood glucose 10-\\n15 minutes after each cycle of hypo treatment.\\nIf a resident has been given several of the above hypo \\ntreatments over a 45-minute period and the blood glucose \\nlevel remains below 4 mmol, please dial 999 and ask for \\nurgent paramedic assistance.\\nSTEP THREE\\nIf, however, the resident’s blood glucose does come up above \\n4 mmol within 45 minutes of giving one of the recommended \\nhypo treatments as indicated in Step 1, ensure the resident is \\nthen given some starchy food to keep the blood glucose levels \\nstable. Examples of starchy food includes:\\n• A banana\\n• Half a sandwich or a piece of toast\\n• 2 plain biscuits\\nIf the next meal is due give this to the resident early\\nResidents should NOT be given any of the following to treat \\na hypo:\\n• Chocolate\\n• Cakes\\n• Biscuits\\n• Milky sugary drinks or any other foods or drinks which \\nmay have a combination of sugar and fat combined within \\nthem\\nThe fat contained within these foods/drinks will prevent the \\nsugar from being released and if these are given this will cause \\nthe resident’s blood glucose to continue to fall and the hypo \\nwill take longer to treat. This may result in serious consequences \\nand the resident may require admission to hospital.'),\n",

The PPC is an in-\\nterprofessional expert committee com-\\nprising physicians, nurse practitioners,\\npharmacists, diabetes care and education\\nspecialists, registered dietitian nutritionists,\\nbehavioral health scientists, and others\\nwho have expertise in a range of areas in-\\ncluding but not limited to adult and pedi-\\natric endocrinology, epidemiology, public\\nhealth, behavioral health, cardiovascular\\nrisk management, microvascular compli-\\ncations, nephrology, neurology, ophthal-\\nmology, podiatry, clinical pharmacology,\\npreconception and pregnancy care, weight\\nmanagement and diabetes prevention,\\nand use of technology in diabetes man-\\nagement. Appointment to the PPC is\\nbased on excellence in clinical practice\\nand research, with attention to appropri-\\nate representation of members based on\\nconsiderations including but not limited\\nto demographic, geographic, work setting,\\nor identity characteristics (e.g., gender,\\nethnicity, ability level). A PPC chairperson\\nis appointed by the ADA (currently N.A.E.)\\nand oversees the committee. For the\\n2024 Standards of Care, as in previous years,\\ntwo representatives from the American\\nCollege of Cardiology (ACC) acted as ex-\\nperts and participated in the development\\nof Section 10,“Cardiovascular Disease and\\nRisk Management.” ACC reviewed and ap-\\nproved the section. In addition, and new\\nto the 2024 Standards of Care, one repre-\\nsentative from the American Society for\\nBone and Mineral Research (ASBMR)\\nand one representative from The Obesity\\nSociety (TOS) acted as external experts\\nfor the“Bone Health” subsection in Sec-\\ntion 4,“Comprehensive Medical Evaluation\\nand Assessment of Comorbidities,” and\\nSection 8, “Obesity and Weight Man-\\nagement for the Prevention and Treatment\\nof Type 2 Diabetes,” respectively. Both soci-\\neties reviewed and approved the section or\\nsubsection in which they were involved.\\nEach section of the Standards of Care\\nis reviewed annually and updated with\\nthe latest evidence-based recommenda-\\ntions by a PPC member designated as the\\nsection lead as well as subcommittee\\nmembers. The subcommittees perform\\nsystematic literature reviews and identify\\nand summarize the scientiﬁc evidence.\\nAn information specialist with knowledge\\nand experience in literature searching\\n(a librarian) is consulted as necessary.\\nA guideline methodologist (R.R.B. for the\\n2024 Standards of Care) with expertise\\na n dt r a i n i n gi ne v i d e n c e - b a s e dm e d i c i n e\\nand guideline development methodology\\noversees all methodological aspects of\\nthe development of the Standards of\\nCare and serves as a statistical analyst.\\nDisclosure and Duality of Interest\\nManagement\\nAll members of the expert panel (the\\nPPC members and subject matter ex-\\nperts) and ADA staff are required to\\ncomply with the ADA policy on duality\\nof interest, which requires disclosure of\\nany ﬁnancial, intellectual, or other inter-\\nests that might be construed as consti-\\ntuting an actual, potential, or apparent\\nconﬂict, regardless of relevancy to the\\nguideline topic. For transparency, ADA\\nrequires full disclosure of all relation-\\nships. Full disclosure statements from\\nall committee members are solicited\\nand reviewed during the appointment\\nprocess. Disclosures are then updated\\nthroughout the guideline development\\nprocess (speciﬁcally before the start of\\nevery meeting), and disclosure state-\\nments are submitted by every Standards\\nof Care author upon submission of the\\nrevised Standards of Care section. Members\\na r er e q u i r e dt od i s c l o s ef o rat i m ef r a m e\\nthat includes 1 year prior to initiation of\\nthe committee appointment process until\\npublication of that year’s Standards of\\nCare. Potential dualities of interest are\\nevaluated by a designated review group\\nand, if necessary, the Legal Affairs Divi-\\nsion of the ADA. The duality of interest\\nassessment is based on the relative\\nweight of the ﬁnancial relationship (i.e.,\\nthe monetary amount) and the relevance\\nof the relationship (i.e., the degree to\\nwhich an independent observer might rea-\\nsonably interpret an association as related\\nto the topic or recommendation of consid-\\neration). In addition, the ADA adheres to\\nsection 7 of the Council of Medical Spe-\\ncialty Societies“Code for Interactions with\\nCompanies” (3). The duality of interest re-\\nview group also ensures the majority of the\\nPPC and the PPC chair are without poten-\\ntial conﬂict relevant to the subject area.\\nFurthermore, the PPC chair is required to\\nremain unconﬂicted for 1 year after the\\npublication of the Standards of Care.\\nMembers of the committee who disclose\\na potential duality of interest pertinent to\\nany speciﬁc recommendation are prohib-\\nited from participating in discussions\\nrelated to those recommendations. No\\nexpert panel members were employees\\nof any pharmaceutical or medical device\\ncompany during the development of\\nthe 2024 Standards of Care.

Theﬁnal evidence summaries are\\nthen deliberated on by the PPC, and the\\nrecommendations that will appear in the\\nStandards of Care are drafted.\\nGrading of Evidence and\\nRecommendation Development\\nA grading system (Table 1) developed\\nby the ADA and modeled after existing\\nm e t h o d si su s e dt oc l a r i f ya n dc o d i f yt h e\\nevidence that forms the basis for the rec-\\nommendations in the Standards of Care.\\nAll of the recommendations in the Stand-\\nards of Care are critical to comprehensive\\ncare regardless of rating. ADA recommen-\\ndations are assigned ratings ofA, B,o rC,\\ndepending on the quality of the evidence\\nin support of the recommendation. Ex-\\npert opinionE is a separate category for\\nrecommendations in which there is no\\nevidence from clinical trials, clinical trials\\nmay be impractical, or there is conﬂicting\\nevidence. Recommendations assigned an\\nE level of evidence are informed by key\\nopinion leaders in theﬁeld of diabetes\\n(members of the PPC) and cover important\\nelements of clinical care. All Standards of\\nCare recommendations receive a rating for\\nthe strength of the evidence and not for\\nthe strength of the recommendation. Rec-\\nommendations withA-level evidence are\\nbased on large, well-designed randomized\\ncontrolled trials or well-done meta-analyses\\nof randomized controlled trials. Generally,\\nthese recommendations have the best\\nchance of improving outcomes when ap-\\nplied to the population for which they are\\nappropriate. Recommendations with lower\\nlevels of evidence may be equally impor-\\ntant but are not as well supported.\\nOf course, published evidence is only\\none component of clinical decision-making.\\nClinicians care for people, not populations;\\nguidelines must always be interpreted with\\nthe individual person in mind. Individual cir-\\ncumstances, such as comorbid and coexist-\\ning diseases, age, education, disability, and,\\nabove all, the values and preferences of the\\nperson with diabetes, must be considered\\nand may lead to different treatment goals\\nand strategies. Furthermore, conventional\\nevidence hierarchies, such as the one\\nadapted by the ADA, may miss nuances im-\\nportant in diabetes care. For example, al-\\nthough there is excellent evidence from\\nclinical trials supporting the importance of\\nachieving multiple risk factor control, the\\noptimal way to achieve this result is less\\nclear. It is difﬁcult to assess each compo-\\nnent of such a complex intervention.\\nEvidence to Recommendations\\nAll accumulated evidence was reviewed and\\ndiscussed by all PPC members during virtual\\nmeetings and a 2-day in-person meeting in\\nArlington, Virginia, in July 2023. Standards of\\nCare recommendations were updated based\\non the newly acquired evidence, and all rec-\\nommendations were voted on by the PPC,\\nwith 80% consensus required for any recom-\\nmendation to be approved.\\nRevision Process\\nPublic comment is particularly important\\nin the development of clinical practice rec-\\nommendations; it promotes transparency\\nand provides key stake holders the oppor-\\ntunity to identify and address gaps in care.\\nThe ADA holds a year-long public comment\\nperiod requesting feedback on the Stand-\\nards of Care. The PPC reviews compiled\\nfeedback from the public in preparation\\nfor the annual update but considers more\\npressing updates throughout the year,\\nwhich may be published as“living” Stand-\\nards updates.

ADA statements undergo a formal\\nreview process, including external peer re-\\nview and review by the appropriate ADA\\nnational committee, ADA clinical leader-\\nship, science and health care staff, and, as\\nwarranted, the ADA Board of Directors.\\nConsensus Report\\nA consensus report on a particular topic\\ncontains a comprehensive examination, is\\nauthored by an expert panel (i.e., consen-\\nsus panel), and represents the panel’sc o l -\\nlective analysis, evaluation, and opinion.\\nThe need for a consensus report arises\\nwhen clinicians, scientists, regulators, and/\\nor policy makers desire guidance and/or\\nclarity on a medical or scientiﬁc issue re-\\nlated to diabetes for which the evidence is\\ncontradictory, emerging, or incomplete.\\nConsensus reports may also highlight evi-\\ndence gaps and propose future research\\nareas to address these gaps. A consensus\\nreport is not an ADA position but repre-\\nsents expert opinion only and is produced\\nunder the auspices of the ADA by invited\\nexperts. A consensus report may be devel-\\noped after an ADA Clinical Conference or\\nResearch Symposium. Consensus reports\\nundergo a formal review process, including\\nexternal peer review and review by the ap-\\npropriate ADA national committee, ADA\\nclinical leadership, and the science and\\nhealth care staff.\\nScientific Review\\nAs c i e n t iﬁc review is a balanced review\\nand analysis of the literature on a scientiﬁc\\nor medical topic related to diabetes. A sci-\\nentiﬁc review is not an ADA position and\\ndoes not contain clinical practice recom-\\nmendations but is produced under the\\nauspices of the ADA by invited experts.\\nThe scientiﬁc review may provide a scien-\\ntiﬁc rationale for clinical practice recom-\\nmendations in the Standards of Care. The\\ncategory may also include task force and\\nexpert committee reports.\\nMembers of the PPC\\nNuha Ali ElSayed, MD, MMSc (Chair)\\nGrazia Aleppo, MD\\nRaveendhara R.
